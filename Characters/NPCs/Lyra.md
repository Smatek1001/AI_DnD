# Lyra

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Human
* **Gender:** Female
* **Age:** (approximate) Late teens
* **Alignment:** Neutral Good
* **Occupation:** Arcane Shop Assistant
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Minor
* **Disposition towards PC:** Neutral (initially wary, but polite)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Lyra is a young [[Human]] woman with an air of quiet efficiency. Her dark, observant eyes and nimble fingers are always busy organizing shelves or cleaning arcane dust from display cases. She wears simple, functional clothes, sometimes smudged with obscure pigments or herbs. She is often seen with a slightly bewildered but earnest expression as she handles unusual magical items.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Diligent, curious, slightly overwhelmed but determined, and surprisingly observant despite her youth.
### Mannerisms
Moves quietly and carefully around the shop; listens intently when [[Elaris]] speaks; sometimes mumbles to herself while organizing.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "There is wonder in the world, and I want to understand its secrets."
**Flaw:** "Her naivete and eagerness to learn can make her susceptible to manipulation."

## IV. Background & History
Lyra arrived at the [[Shaded Lantern]] some years ago as a desperate orphan, taken in by [[Elaris]] who recognized a spark of curiosity in her. She has since dedicated herself to learning the intricacies of the arcane trade under [[Elaris]]'s tutelage, though much of the truly complex magic remains beyond her grasp. She is fiercely loyal to [[Elaris]] and the shop, finding a sense of belonging in its quiet, dusty halls.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Master the tasks assigned by [[Elaris]]; learn more about the arcane items she handles; avoid breaking anything valuable.
### Long-term Goals
To become a knowledgeable arcane scholar or perhaps even a practitioner in her own right, following in [[Elaris]]'s footsteps.
### Primary Motivation
Learning and a desire for security and belonging.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** None
* **Other Affiliations:** None beyond her association with [[Elaris]] and the [[Shaded Lantern]].

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Always at the [[Shaded Lantern]].
* **Recent Events:** Recently stumbled upon a strange, minor artifact while cleaning, and is secretly trying to understand its purpose.
* **Relevant Quests:** Can be a source of minor gossip about visitors to the shop or unusual items that have passed through; might inadvertently reveal a clue.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Lyra might accidentally activate a cursed item, requiring [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s help; she could be approached by someone trying to get information about [[Elaris]] or the shop's inventory; she might be interested in a seemingly mundane item [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]] possesses, hinting at its true nature.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Lyra should be portrayed as a contrast to the grimdark setting â€“ a small flicker of innocence or earnestness. Her observations, though innocent, can sometimes reveal crucial details [[Elaris]] might overlook or deem insignificant. She looks up to [[Elaris]] greatly.
