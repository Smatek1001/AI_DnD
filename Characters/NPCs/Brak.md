# Brak

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Half-Orc
* **Gender:** Male
* **Age:** (approximate) 30s
* **Alignment:** Neutral Evil
* **Occupation:** Thug / Enforcer
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Minor
* **Disposition towards PC:** Hostile (especially if they interfere with [[Skarlix]] or Syndicate business)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Brak is a hulking [[half-orc]] in his 30s. His scarred knuckles and crooked nose speak of countless brawls. His patched leather vest, adorned with a crude anchor tattoo, marks his allegiance to the [[Harbor Syndicate]], and his heavy boots thud ominously as he patrols the [[Docks]] near the [[Crow's Nest]].

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Brutish and loyal, Brak relishes intimidation. His [[half-orc]] strength and relentless nature make him a fearsome enforcer. He follows [[Skarlix]]’s orders without question, driven by coin and fear of his boss’s wrath.
### Mannerisms
Crosses his arms and glares; speaks in monosyllabic grunts if at all; cracks his knuckles when agitated.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Strength is the only true currency."
**Flaw:** "He is easily outsmarted and relies entirely on brute force. His temper is a weakness."

## IV. Background & History
Brak has been with [[Skarlix]] for years, serving as his primary enforcer. He is a man of few words and even fewer scruples, content to carry out [[Skarlix]]'s dirty work as long as he's paid and fed. He sees himself as a tool, but a very effective one.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Follow [[Skarlix]]'s orders, keep the peace (or break it) at the [[Crow's Nest]], and ensure debts are paid.
### Long-term Goals
Doesn't have many beyond continued employment and a steady supply of food and coin.
### Primary Motivation
Loyalty (to [[Skarlix]]/[[Harbor Syndicate]]) and a simple, brutal existence.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** [[Harbor Syndicate]] (Directly employed by [[Skarlix]] within the Syndicate's ranks)
* **Other Affiliations:** None.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Always near [[Skarlix]] at the [[Crow's Nest]], or out on collection runs in the [[Docks]] district.
* **Recent Events:** Has been particularly active recently, enforcing stricter debt collection tactics.
* **Relevant Quests:** A major physical obstacle to any direct infiltration or confrontation with [[Skarlix]]; could be interrogated (though difficult) for Syndicate information if captured.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Brak could be encountered intimidating a civilian; he might be targeted by a rival gang, creating an opportunity for [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]] to intervene or exploit the situation.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Brak is a straightforward bruiser. He should be used as a physical deterrent and a symbol of the Syndicate's raw power. He's not subtle and will react predictably to direct threats. His [[half-orc]] strength and "Relentless Endurance" (mechanic from npcs.txt, source 128) should make him a formidable foe.
