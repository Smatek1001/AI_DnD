# Brak

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Human
* **Gender:** Male
* **Age:** (approximate) 30s
* **Alignment:** Neutral Evil
* **Occupation:** Thug / Enforcer
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Minor
* **Disposition towards PC:** Hostile (especially if they interfere with Skarlix or Syndicate business)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Brak is a hulking man, broad-shouldered and scarred, with dull, intimidating eyes. He favors simple, heavy leather armor and always has a bludgeoning weapon (like a weighted club) within easy reach. He rarely speaks, letting his imposing presence and clenched fists do most of the talking.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Brutal, silent, fiercely loyal to Skarlix (for now), and quick to resort to violence.
### Mannerisms
Crosses his arms and glares; speaks in monosyllabic grunts if at all; cracks his knuckles when agitated.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Strength is the only true currency."
**Flaw:** "He is easily outsmarted and relies entirely on brute force."

## IV. Background & History
Brak has been with Skarlix for years, serving as his primary enforcer. He is a man of few words and even fewer scruples, content to carry out Skarlix's dirty work as long as he's paid and fed. He sees himself as a tool, but a very effective one.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Follow Skarlix's orders, keep the peace (or break it) at the Crow's Nest, and ensure debts are paid.
### Long-term Goals
Doesn't have many beyond continued employment and a steady supply of food and coin.
### Primary Motivation
Loyalty (to Skarlix/Syndicate) and a simple, brutal existence.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** [[Harbor Syndicate]] (Directly employed by Skarlix within the Syndicate's ranks)
* **Other Affiliations:** None.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Always near [[Skarlix]] at the [[Crow's Nest]], or out on collection runs in the [[Docks]] district.
* **Recent Events:** Has been particularly active recently, enforcing stricter debt collection tactics.
* **Relevant Quests:** Can be a physical obstacle to overcome when dealing with Skarlix; could be interrogated (though difficult) for Syndicate information if captured.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Brak could be encountered intimidating a civilian; he might be targeted by a rival gang, creating an opportunity for Vaelin to intervene or exploit the situation.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Brak is a straightforward bruiser. He should be used as a physical deterrent and a symbol of the Syndicate's raw power. He's not subtle and reacts predictably to direct threats.
