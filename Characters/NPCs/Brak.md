# Brak

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Half-Orc
* **Gender:** Male
* **Age:** (approximate) 30s
* **Alignment:** Neutral Evil
* **Occupation:** Thug / Enforcer
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Minor
* **Disposition towards PC:** Hostile (especially if they interfere with [[Characters/NPCs/Skarlix|Skarlix]] or Syndicate business)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Brak is a hulking half-orc in his 30s. His scarred knuckles and crooked nose speak of countless brawls. His patched leather vest, adorned with a crude anchor tattoo, marks his allegiance to the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]], and his heavy boots thud ominously as he patrols the [[Locations/Docks|Docks]] near the [[Locations/Crow's_Nest|Crow's Nest]].

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Brutish and loyal, Brak relishes intimidation. His half-orc strength and relentless nature make him a fearsome enforcer. He follows [[Characters/NPCs/Skarlix|Skarlix]]’s orders without question, driven by coin and fear of his boss’s wrath.
### Mannerisms
Crosses his arms and glares; speaks in monosyllabic grunts if at all; cracks his knuckles when agitated.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Strength is the only true currency."
**Flaw:** "He is easily outsmarted and relies entirely on brute force. His temper is a weakness."

## IV. Background & History
Brak has been with [[Characters/NPCs/Skarlix|Skarlix]] for years, serving as his primary enforcer. He is a man of few words and even fewer scruples, content to carry out [[Characters/NPCs/Skarlix|Skarlix]]'s dirty work as long as he's paid and fed. He sees himself as a tool, but a very effective one.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Follow [[Characters/NPCs/Skarlix|Skarlix]]'s orders, keep the peace (or break it) at the [[Locations/Crow's_Nest|Crow's Nest]], and ensure debts are paid.
### Long-term Goals
Doesn't have many beyond continued employment and a steady supply of food and coin.
### Primary Motivation
Loyalty (to [[Characters/NPCs/Skarlix|Skarlix]]/[[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]]) and a simple, brutal existence.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]] (Directly employed by [[Characters/NPCs/Skarlix|Skarlix]] within the Syndicate's ranks)
* **Other Affiliations:** None.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Always near [[Characters/NPCs/Skarlix|Skarlix]] at the [[Locations/Crow's_Nest|Crow's Nest]], or out on collection runs in the [[Locations/Docks|Docks]] district.
* **Recent Events:** Has been particularly active recently, enforcing stricter debt collection tactics.
* **Relevant Quests:** A major physical obstacle to any direct infiltration or confrontation with [[Characters/NPCs/Skarlix|Skarlix]]; could be interrogated (though difficult) for Syndicate information if captured.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Brak could be encountered intimidating a civilian; he might be targeted by a rival gang, creating an opportunity for [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] to intervene or exploit the situation.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Brak is a straightforward bruiser. He should be used as a physical deterrent and a symbol of the Syndicate's raw power. He's not subtle and will react predictably to direct threats. His half-orc strength and "Relentless Endurance" should make him a formidable foe.
