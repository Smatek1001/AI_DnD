# Kyssra

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Drow
* **Gender:** Female
* **Age:** (approximate) Early 20s
* **Alignment:** Neutral Evil
* **Occupation:** Nightshade Guild Lookout
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Minor
* **Disposition towards PC:** Wary (initially suspicious)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Kyssra is a lean and agile drow, with dark, obsidian skin and stark white hair often pulled back tightly. Her crimson eyes are constantly scanning, betraying a sense of perpetual alertness. She favors practical, dark clothing that allows her to blend into the shadows, and she rarely smiles, her expression usually a mask of guarded suspicion. There's a subtle, inherent grace in her movements.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Alert, suspicious, loyal to the Guild, and a keen observer.
### Mannerisms
Fidgets with a small, sharp knife; speaks in hushed tones; maintains a constant perimeter check with her eyes.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Vigilance is the first step to survival."
**Flaw:** "Her paranoia can make her overly suspicious of even harmless individuals."

## IV. Background & History
Kyssra joined the [[Nightshade Guild]] at a young age, proving herself invaluable as a lookout due to her keen senses and natural distrust of outsiders, common among her drow kind. She often works in tandem with [[Jib]], covering the approaches to the [[Whispering Door]] and ensuring the Guild's operations remain undetected.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Maintain the security of the [[Whispering Door]]; report any suspicious activity to her superiors; avoid detection.
### Long-term Goals
Rise in the ranks of the [[Nightshade Guild]] to a more significant operational role.
### Primary Motivation
Security and advancement within the Guild.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** [[Nightshade Guild]] (Dedicated Lookout)
* **Other Affiliations:** None specific.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Stationed at the entrance or on nearby rooftops overlooking the [[Whispering Door]].
* **Recent Events:** Has noticed a marked increase in suspicious activity near the [[Whispering Door]] following a recent Guild heist.
* **Relevant Quests:** Can be a source of ambient information regarding who comes and goes from the Whispering Door, or who is currently under the Guild's surveillance.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Kyssra might spot Vaelin attempting to infiltrate the Guild's territory; she could be bribed or coerced into providing a distraction; she might be targeted by a rival faction seeking to bypass the Guild's security.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Kyssra's dialogue should be minimal and focused on her duties. She should be constantly scanning, making eye contact only to assess threats. If Vaelin is observed, her reaction should be quick and discreet, alerting Guild members without drawing public attention. Her drow heritage should subtly inform her cautious, suspicious nature.
