# Kyssra

## I. Overview
* **Race:** [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Elf_Race_2024#B. Drow|Drow]]
* **Gender:** Female
* **Age:** (approximate) 30s
* **Alignment:** Neutral Evil
* **Occupation:** Nightshade Guild Lookout
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Minor
* **Disposition towards PC:** Wary (initially suspicious)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Kyssra is a skinny [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Elf_Race_2024#B. Drow|Drow]] woman in her 30s, with dark skin and a scar over her left eye that marks her as a seasoned lookout. Her tattered cloak blends into the [[Locations/Veil|Veil]]’s shadows as she paces near the [[Locations/Whispering_Door|Whispering Door]] tavern. Her violet eyes constantly scan the fog, missing little. She rarely smiles, her expression usually a mask of guarded suspicion.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Jumpy and loyal, Kyssra is highly alert and a keen observer. She distrusts outsiders but follows [[Characters/NPCs/Vrenna|Vrenna]]’s orders without question.
### Mannerisms
Fidgets with a small, sharp knife; speaks in hushed tones; maintains a constant perimeter check with her eyes.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Vigilance is the first step to survival."
**Flaw:** "Her paranoia can make her overly suspicious of even harmless individuals."

## IV. Background & History
Kyssra joined the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]] at a young age, proving herself invaluable as a lookout due to her keen senses and natural distrust of outsiders, common among her [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Elf_Race_2024#B. Drow|Drow]] kind. Her [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Elf_Race_2024#B. Drow|Drow]] agility and darkvision make her a vigilant scout for the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]. She often works in tandem with [[Characters/NPCs/Jib|Jib]], covering the approaches to the [[Locations/Whispering_Door|Whispering Door]] and ensuring the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]'s operations remain undetected.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Maintain the security of the [[Locations/Whispering_Door|Whispering Door]]; report any suspicious activity to her superiors; avoid detection.
### Long-term Goals
Rise in the ranks of the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]] to a more significant operational role.
### Primary Motivation
Security and advancement within the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]].

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]] (Dedicated Lookout)
* **Other Affiliations:** None specific.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Stationed at the entrance or on nearby rooftops overlooking the [[Locations/Whispering_Door|Whispering Door]].
* **Recent Events:** Has noticed a marked increase in suspicious activity near the [[Locations/Whispering_Door|Whispering Door]] following a recent [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]] heist.
* **Relevant Quests:** Can be a source of ambient information regarding who comes and goes from the [[Locations/Whispering_Door|Whispering Door]], or who is currently under the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]'s surveillance.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Kyssra might spot [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] attempting to infiltrate the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]'s territory; she could be bribed or coerced into providing a distraction; she might be targeted by a rival faction seeking to bypass the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]'s security.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Kyssra's dialogue should be minimal and focused on her duties. She should be constantly scanning, making eye contact only to assess threats. If [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] is observed, her reaction should be quick and discreet, alerting [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]] members without drawing public attention. Her [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Elf_Race_2024#B. Drow|Drow]] heritage should subtly inform her cautious, suspicious nature.
