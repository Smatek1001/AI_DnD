# Silas Blackwood

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Human
* **Gender:** Male
* **Age:** (approximate) Late 50s
* **Alignment:** Neutral Evil (Likely driven by greed, deals in sensitive items)
* **Occupation:** Proprietor of "Blackwood's Baubles" - a jeweler and dealer in specialty goods, some likely illicit or acquired through questionable means.
* **Status:** alive (and likely furious about the recent heist)
* **Importance:** Supporting
* **Disposition towards PC:** Hostile (Unaware of Vaelin's identity, but will be actively seeking perpetrator of the heist)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Silas Blackwood is a portly, balding human man in his late 50s. When last seen (by Lirael during scouting), he was dressed in a slightly stained silk nightshirt. He likely presents a more professional, if somewhat fussy, appearance during business hours. Finch described him as "miserly."

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Likely shrewd, security-conscious (given the guards and warded items), and primarily motivated by profit. Finch's description as "miserly" suggests he is reluctant to part with wealth. His reaction to the heist will likely be one of outrage and a desire for recovery or retribution.
### Mannerisms
(To be further developed if directly interacted with, but likely precise and valuing his merchandise highly).
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Every valuable item has its price, and its security is paramount."
**Flaw:** "His greed and involvement with shadowy figures like Magister Vayne may expose him to significant risks." (As evidenced by the heist).

## IV. Background & History
Silas Blackwood owns and operates "Blackwood's Baubles," a modest-looking but well-maintained two-story shop in a commercial district of [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]. While appearing as a legitimate jeweler, he also handles rare, magical, and sensitive items, suggesting connections to an exclusive or clandestine clientele. He is known to have dealings with "Magister Vayne," for whom he was likely holding or working on the "Occulus Array" and "Resonance Core." His shop was recently and successfully heisted by [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]].

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
* Discover the perpetrator(s) of the heist.
* Recover his stolen goods, especially the items belonging to Magister Vayne.
* Significantly increase security at his shop.
* Report the theft to Magister Vayne.
### Long-term Goals
* Continue his profitable business dealing in specialty and potentially illicit goods.
* Maintain his valuable (if dangerous) connections.
### Primary Motivation
Profit, and likely fear of repercussions from clients like Magister Vayne if their items are not recovered.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** None (operates independently)
* **Other Affiliations:** Client/supplier relationship with "Magister Vayne." Deals with an exclusive, possibly underworld-connected clientele.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** His shop, [[Locations/Blackwood's_Baubles|Blackwood's Baubles]].
* **Recent Events:** His shop was thoroughly looted by [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]. He is likely in the process of discovering the theft or has just discovered it.
* **Relevant Quests:** The fallout from the [[Quests/Completed/Blackwood's_Baubles_Heist|Blackwood's Baubles Heist]] is a major ongoing plot thread.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:**
    * Blackwood might hire investigators or put out a bounty for the recovery of his goods or the capture of the thief, creating a threat for Vaelin.
    * His attempts to explain the loss to Magister Vayne could be intercepted or observed by Vaelin.
    * He might become a source of information on Magister Vayne if pressured or manipulated.
    * The increased security at his shop could present a new challenge or point of interest.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Silas Blackwood is now an antagonistic figure whose actions will be driven by the recent heist. He represents a loose end and a potential source of future conflict or information regarding Magister Vayne. His shop also contained mundane customer repair items which Vaelin still has.
