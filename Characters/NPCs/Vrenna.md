# Vrenna

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Drow
* **Gender:** Female
* **Age:** (approximate) 70s
* **Alignment:** Lawful Evil
* **Occupation:** Nightshade Guild Elder leading heists
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Supporting (influential)
* **Disposition towards PC:** Wary (sees [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]] as a potential asset or threat)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Vrenna is a wiry drow woman in her 70s. Her scarred face and cold violet eyes mark her as a seasoned thief. Her dark leathers bristle with lockpicks and blades. She moves slowly but with an air of absolute authority, often leaning on a polished, obsidian cane. Despite her age, an aura of dark power subtly clings to her.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Ruthless and pragmatic, Vrenna’s drow agility and darkvision make her a master thief. She is cunning, patient, and deeply entrenched in the Guild's traditions and power structure. She is rarely seen without an air of severe contemplation.
### Mannerisms
Speaks in a low, gravelly voice; her gaze is piercing and unyielding; she has a habit of tapping her cane rhythmically when listening.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "The Guild's influence must grow, and its secrets must be protected at all costs."
**Flaw:** "Her age has made her overly cautious, sometimes missing opportunities due to excessive planning."

## IV. Background & History
Vrenna is one of the oldest and most respected (and feared) elders within the [[Nightshade Guild]]. Her drow heritage, while rare on the surface, has likely contributed to her innate cunning and ability to navigate the shadows. She has witnessed the Guild's rise to prominence in [[Duskhaven]]'s underworld and has personally overseen countless heists and assassinations, coordinating thefts like [[Rynna]]’s fencing operations. She embodies the Guild's ruthless efficiency and its deep-seated desire for power and wealth through illicit means. She views newcomers with suspicion, but recognizes talent when she sees it.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Consolidate the Guild's power in the [[Veil]] district; eliminate any direct threats to the Guild's operations. Lead successful heists.
### Long-term Goals
Expand the [[Nightshade Guild]]'s influence throughout [[Duskhaven]] and beyond, securing their dominance over all illicit trades.
### Primary Motivation
Power, control, and the preservation of the Guild's legacy.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** [[Nightshade Guild]] (Elder, Head of Heists)
* **Other Affiliations:** Has deep, long-standing connections with other criminal syndicates and shadowy figures outside of [[Duskhaven]], potentially even those from the Underdark.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Often found in a secluded area of the [[Whispering Door]], conducting private meetings.
* **Recent Events:** Has recently taken a keen interest in rumors of powerful, ancient artifacts surfacing in [[Duskhaven]], seeing them as potential targets for the Guild.
* **Relevant Quests:** Can be a source of high-level, dangerous missions for [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]] if he proves his worth to the Guild; holds vast knowledge of [[Duskhaven]]'s criminal underworld.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Vrenna might offer Vaelin a tantalizing but morally ambiguous quest that could greatly benefit the Guild (and Vaelin); she could be targeted by a rival faction, creating a high-stakes protection mission; she might possess a piece of information related to Vaelin's past or [[Therandril]], using it as leverage.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Vrenna should be portrayed as a formidable, calculating figure. Her words are few but carry immense weight. Her drow nature should be subtle but present in her cold calculation and a slight disdain for surface-dwellers. She should appear frail but her mind is sharp as a razor. Her interactions with Vaelin should be cold and analytical, valuing him only for his utility.
