* **Age:** (approximate) 70s
* **Alignment:** Lawful Evil
* **Occupation:** Nightshade Guild Elder leading heists
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Supporting (influential)
* **Disposition towards PC:** Wary (sees [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] as a potential asset or threat)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Vrenna is a wiry [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Elf_Race_2024#B. Drow|Drow]] woman in her 70s. Her scarred face and cold violet eyes mark her as a seasoned thief. Her dark leathers bristle with lockpicks and blades. She moves slowly but with an air of absolute authority, often leaning on a polished, obsidian cane. Despite her age, an aura of dark power subtly clings to her.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Ruthless and pragmatic, Vrenna’s [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Elf_Race_2024#B. Drow|Drow]] agility and darkvision make her a master thief. She is cunning, patient, and deeply entrenched in the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]'s traditions and power structure. She is rarely seen without an air of severe contemplation.
### Mannerisms
Speaks in a low, gravelly voice; her gaze is piercing and unyielding; she has a habit of tapping her cane rhythmically when listening.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "The Guild's influence must grow, and its secrets must be protected at all costs."
**Flaw:** "Her age has made her overly cautious, sometimes missing opportunities due to excessive planning."

## IV. Background & History
Vrenna is one of the oldest and most respected (and feared) elders within the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]. Her [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Elf_Race_2024#B. Drow|Drow]] heritage, while rare on the surface, has likely contributed to her innate cunning and ability to navigate the shadows. She has witnessed the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]'s rise to prominence in [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]'s underworld and has personally overseen countless heists and assassinations, coordinating thefts like [[Characters/NPCs/Rynna|Rynna]]’s fencing operations. She embodies the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]'s ruthless efficiency and its deep-seated desire for power and wealth through illicit means. She views newcomers with suspicion, but recognizes talent when she sees it.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Consolidate the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]'s power in the [[Locations/Veil|Veil]] district; eliminate any direct threats to the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]'s operations. Lead successful heists.
### Long-term Goals
Expand the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]'s influence throughout [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]] and beyond, securing their dominance over all illicit trades.
### Primary Motivation
Power, control, and the preservation of the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]'s legacy.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]] (Elder, Head of Heists)
* **Other Affiliations:** Has deep, long-standing connections with other criminal syndicates and shadowy figures outside of [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]], potentially even those from the Underdark.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Often found in a secluded area of the [[Locations/Whispering_Door|Whispering Door]], conducting private meetings.
* **Recent Events:** Has recently taken a keen interest in rumors of powerful, ancient artifacts surfacing in [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]], seeing them as potential targets for the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]].
* **Relevant Quests:** Can be a source of high-level, dangerous missions for [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] if he proves his worth to the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]; holds vast knowledge of [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]'s criminal underworld.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Vrenna might offer [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] a tantalizing but morally ambiguous quest that could greatly benefit the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]] (and [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]); she could be targeted by a rival faction, creating a high-stakes protection mission; she might possess a piece of information related to [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s past or [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]], using it as leverage.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Vrenna should be portrayed as a formidable, calculating figure. Her words are few but carry immense weight. Her [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Elf_Race_2024#B. Drow|Drow]] nature should be subtle but present in her cold calculation and a slight disdain for surface-dwellers. She should appear frail but her mind is sharp as a razor. Her interactions with [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] should be cold and analytical, valuing him only for his utility.
