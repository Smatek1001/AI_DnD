# Elyndra

## I. Overview
* **Race:** High Elf
* **Gender:** Female
* **Age:** (approximate) 200s
* **Alignment:** Lawful Neutral
* **Occupation:** Society Elder / [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin_Shadowleaf]]'s Mentor
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Pivotal
* **Disposition towards PC:** Neutral (professional, discerning, with a hint of observation)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Elyndra is a tall [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Elf_Race_2024#C. High Elves|High Elf]] woman in her 200s. Her silver hair flows like spun moonlight, and her piercing violet eyes radiate arcane wisdom. Her elegant robes hide a steely resolve, and her [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]] heritage ties her to [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin_Shadowleaf]]’s past. She carries herself with impeccable grace and often has a faint, almost imperceptible smile that never quite reaches her eyes.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Stern yet nurturing, Elyndra balances loyalty to [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]] with personal guilt over [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]]’s inaction. She is calculated, enigmatic, highly intelligent, and patient. Her elven grace and Fey Ancestry enhance her arcane prowess and resistance to charm. She is ambitious and Type A.
### Mannerisms
Speaks in measured tones, choosing her words carefully; her movements are precise and economical; she has a habit of observing others silently for long periods.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Order and control, achieved through information and subtle manipulation, are necessary for true progress."
**Flaw:** "Her pursuit of [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]]'s goals can lead her to disregard individual lives or moral qualms. She looks down on those who don’t strive for greatness."

## IV. Background & History
Elyndra is one of the most senior and influential elders within [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]]. She personally took [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] in as a street kid, seeing his potential and training him as a spy for [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]]. Her background is shrouded in mystery, but her [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]] heritage ties her directly to [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin_Shadowleaf]]'s past and the fall of [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]]. She acts as [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin_Shadowleaf]]'s primary contact for high-level [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]] missions, guiding his missions from the [[Locations/High_District|High District]] or [[Locations/Shadow_Quarter|Shadow Quarter]].

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Guide [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] through his current assignments, subtly testing his loyalty and capabilities; advance [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]]'s immediate objectives in [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]. She is deeply invested in [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin_Shadowleaf]]’s success as her protégé, having trained him since his street days, but expects him to deliver results.
### Long-term Goals
To further [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]]'s overarching, enigmatic agenda, which may be tied to ancient arcane secrets or the nature of [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]] and [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/The_Nameless_Void|The Nameless Void]]. She envisions [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] rising with her, as her right hand, now that she’s secured a provisional council seat.
### Primary Motivation
Duty and allegiance to [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]]'s grand, unseen purpose, coupled with a deep investment in [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin_Shadowleaf]]'s potential.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]] (Elder / High-ranking member)
* **Other Affiliations:** Potentially has covert connections with other powerful, secretive organizations or individuals outside of [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]], if it serves [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]]'s aims.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Primarily within [[Locations/Starfall_Manor|Starfall Manor]], rarely venturing outside unless for critical [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]] business. She may guide [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin_Shadowleaf]]’s missions from the [[Locations/High_District|High District]] or [[Locations/Shadow_Quarter|Shadow Quarter]].
* **Recent Events:** Has recently initiated a series of inquiries into unusual arcane disturbances occurring in the [[Locations/Veil|Veil]] district, which may tie into [[Factions/The_Cult|The Cult]] or the lingering influence of [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/The_Nameless_Void|The Nameless Void]].
* **Relevant Quests:** The primary source of high-stakes missions and direct orders from [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]]; the key to unlocking more information about [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin_Shadowleaf]]'s past and [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]].
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Elyndra might assign [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] a mission that subtly forces him to confront his past; she could provide a cryptic clue about the true nature of his amulet or tattoo; she might be targeted by enemies of [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]], forcing [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] into a difficult choice. Failure to deliver results could strain their bond.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Elyndra should be portrayed as an ancient, calculating presence. Her words should be carefully chosen, and she should reveal information only when absolutely necessary or to further test [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin_Shadowleaf]]. Her interest in [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] should feel strategic, not purely personal, though she acknowledges his capability and has high standards for him.
