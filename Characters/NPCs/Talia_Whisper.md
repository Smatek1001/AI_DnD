# Talia "Whisper"

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Human
* **Gender:** Female
* **Age:** (approximate) 30s
* **Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral
* **Occupation:** Society Operative / Vaelin’s Mission Contact
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Supporting
* **Disposition towards PC:** Friendly (sees [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] as a little brother and junior partner)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Talia is a lithe [[Human]] woman in her 30s with sharp grey eyes and dark hair tucked under a hood. She moves with calculated grace. Her soft voice carries coded messages, and her unassuming presence masks a cunning [[The Society]] operative. Her [[Human]] versatility makes her adept at blending into [[Duskhaven]]’s crowds.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Ambitious and Type A, Talia is driven to rise within [[The Society]], expecting the same dedication from others. She is resourceful, pragmatic, and cautious. She cares deeply for [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]], wanting him to grow and succeed alongside her, but pushes him hard to realize his potential, looking down on those who don’t strive for greatness.
### Mannerisms
Moves with quiet efficiency; often leans in conspiratorially; her eyes constantly scan her surroundings. Her soft voice carries coded messages.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Information is power, and knowing when to use it is survival."
**Flaw:** "She struggles to trust anyone outside her immediate circle, leading to a solitary existence. Her ambition can lead her to push others, even allies, too hard."

## IV. Background & History
Talia was recruited into [[The Society]] years before [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]], becoming a seasoned operative in [[Duskhaven]]'s underworld. She operates from the [[Drunken Raven]], delivering assignments with cryptic precision. She recently secured a provisional council seat in [[The Society]], aiming to solidify her position through [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]]’s successes. She sees [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] as a little brother and junior partner, a bond forged through years of mentorship after [[Elyndra]] trained him. More experienced than [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]], she assigns challenging missions to push his growth, expecting much because she believes in his potential to be a top operative.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Successfully complete current [[The Society]] missions, expand her information network, and keep her contacts safe. As she’s secured a provisional council seat, she aims to solidify her position through [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]]’s successes.
### Long-term Goals
To rise within [[The Society]] and secure her position as a high-ranking elder, with [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] as her right hand.
### Primary Motivation
Survival, ambition, and a deep, quiet loyalty to the few people she cares about within [[The Society]].

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** [[The Society]] (Key information operative, provisional council member)
* **Other Affiliations:** Has numerous informal contacts and informants across [[Duskhaven]]'s various districts and factions.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Mostly at the [[Drunken Raven]], but moves covertly throughout [[Duskhaven]].
* **Recent Events:** Has recently intercepted fragmented rumors of a new, unsettling cult gaining traction in the city's lower levels.
* **Relevant Quests:** A primary source of missions and information for [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]]; can provide assistance on a wide range of espionage and intelligence-gathering tasks.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Talia might be captured or compromised, requiring [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]]'s intervention; she could provide a crucial lead on [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]]'s past or [[Therandril]]; she might assign a mission that pits [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] against another powerful faction. She’ll express frustration if [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] falters (e.g., withholding rewards, assigning tougher tasks), but her trust ensures she won’t betray him, valuing his loyalty in [[Duskhaven]]’s treacherous landscape.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Talia should speak in a low, conspiratorial tone. She always has a piece of information or a task ready. She cares for [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] like a sibling and will subtly try to keep him out of unnecessary danger, without being overbearing. Her ambition is a key driving force.
