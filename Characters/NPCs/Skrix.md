# Skrix

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Goblin
* **Gender:** Male
* **Age:** (approximate) 20s
* **Alignment:** Neutral Evil
* **Occupation:** Harbor Syndicate Courier
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Minor
* **Disposition towards PC:** Neutral (unless interfered with)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Skrix is a small, nimble goblin, almost unnervingly quick. His green skin is often smudged with ink or grime, and he has sharp, intelligent eyes that constantly dart about, assessing threats and opportunities. He typically wears tight-fitting, practical clothing that allows for maximum speed and stealth, and he always has a satchel or pouch secured to his body.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Fast, reliable, secretive, and highly focused on his mission. He has a keen eye for potential shortcuts and escape routes.
### Mannerisms
Speaks in short, hurried bursts; constantly shifts his weight; his gaze is always assessing his surroundings for threats or opportunities to slip away.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Information must flow unimpeded, and I am its fastest vessel."
**Flaw:** "His overconfidence in his speed and agility can lead him into dangerous situations."

## IV. Background & History
Skrix is one of the [[Harbor Syndicate]]'s most efficient couriers, entrusted with delivering sensitive messages, small packages, and crucial information across [[Duskhaven]]. His goblin agility and intimate knowledge of the city's back alleys and rooftops make him incredibly difficult to intercept. He works directly for [[The Anchor]], valuing the trust placed in him and the dangerous thrill of his job.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Deliver his current message/package without detection or interception; outmaneuver any pursuers.
### Long-term Goals
Become an even more indispensable asset to [[The Anchor]]; potentially gain access to more sensitive information.
### Primary Motivation
Efficiency, speed, and proving his worth.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** [[Harbor Syndicate]] (Key Courier)
* **Other Affiliations:** Has informal contacts with other couriers and street runners in Duskhaven.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Constantly moving throughout [[Duskhaven]], originating from or returning to the [[Syndicate Warehouse]].
* **Recent Events:** Is currently carrying a message or package of high importance related to the Syndicate's recent tightening of security.
* **Relevant Quests:** A prime target for interception if Vaelin needs to acquire Syndicate intel or disrupt their communication; can be a source of ambient information if observed.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Skrix might inadvertently lead Vaelin to a secret Syndicate meeting; he could be cornered by rival agents, creating an opportunity for Vaelin to intervene or exploit; he might drop a crucial piece of information that Vaelin can discover.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Skrix should be portrayed as a blur of motion. Encounters with him should emphasize his speed and Vaelin's stealth/pursuit skills. He will not engage in combat unless cornered, preferring to escape.
