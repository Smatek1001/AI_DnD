# Skrix

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Goblin
* **Gender:** Male
* **Age:** (approximate) 20s
* **Alignment:** Neutral Evil
* **Occupation:** Harbor Syndicate Courier
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Minor
* **Disposition towards PC:** Neutral (unless interfered with)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Skrix is a twitchy Goblin in his 20s. His beady red eyes and ragged cloak mark him as a nervous courier. His quick claws clutch [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]] packages tightly. He is small and nimble, almost unnervingly quick. His green skin is often smudged with ink or grime. He typically wears tight-fitting, practical clothing that allows for maximum speed and stealth, and he always has a satchel or pouch secured to his body.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Paranoid and skittish, Skrix survives through speed and cunning. His Goblin nimbleness and keen senses make him hard to catch. Loyal to [[Characters/NPCs/The_Anchor|The Anchor]] out of fear, heâ€™s open to betrayal for safety. He is reliable and highly focused on his mission.
### Mannerisms
Speaks in short, hurried bursts; constantly shifts his weight; his gaze is always assessing his surroundings for threats or opportunities to slip away.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Information must flow unimpeded, and I am its fastest vessel."
**Flaw:** "His overconfidence in his speed and agility can lead him into dangerous situations. His fear can make him betray allies."

## IV. Background & History
Skrix is one of the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]]'s most efficient couriers, entrusted with delivering sensitive messages, small packages, and crucial information across [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]. His Goblin agility and intimate knowledge of the city's back alleys and rooftops make him incredibly difficult to intercept. He works directly for [[Characters/NPCs/The_Anchor|The Anchor]], valuing the trust placed in him and the dangerous thrill of his job.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Deliver his current message/package without detection or interception; outmaneuver any pursuers.
### Long-term Goals
Become an even more indispensable asset to [[Characters/NPCs/The_Anchor|The Anchor]]; potentially gain access to more sensitive information.
### Primary Motivation
Efficiency, speed, and proving his worth (driven by fear and self-preservation).

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]] (Key Courier)
* **Other Affiliations:** Has informal contacts with other couriers and street runners in [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]].

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Constantly moving throughout [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]], originating from or returning to the [[Locations/Syndicate_Warehouse|Syndicate Warehouse]].
* **Recent Events:** Is currently carrying a message or package of high importance related to the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]]'s recent tightening of security.
* **Relevant Quests:** A prime target for interception if [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] needs to acquire [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]] intel or disrupt their communication; can be a source of ambient information if observed.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Skrix might inadvertently lead [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] to a secret [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]] meeting; he could be cornered by rival agents, creating an opportunity for [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] to intervene or exploit; he might drop a crucial piece of information that [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] can discover.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Skrix should be portrayed as a blur of motion. Encounters with him should emphasize his speed and [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s stealth/pursuit skills. He will not engage in combat unless cornered, preferring to escape. His paranoia should be a key personality trait.
