# The Forger

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Human
* **Gender:** Male
* **Age:** (approximate) 50s
* **Alignment:** Neutral Evil
* **Occupation:** Master Forger / Document Faker
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Minor
* **Disposition towards PC:** Neutral (purely transactional)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
The Forger is a small, unassuming man with perpetually ink-stained fingers and a pair of thick spectacles perched on his nose. He has a nervous twitch and often squints, as if constantly examining fine details. He dresses plainly, attempting to blend into the background, but his hands betray his craft with their calluses and precision.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Meticulous, secretive, obsessed with detail, and highly skilled in his craft. He is generally timid outside of his work.
### Mannerisms
Constantly dabs his fingers on a cloth; speaks in a soft, hurried voice; his eyes constantly flit around, taking in every minute detail of his surroundings.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Perfection in deception is the ultimate art form."
**Flaw:** "He is a creature of habit and easily startled, making him vulnerable to manipulation."

## IV. Background & History
Little is known about The Forger's past, save that he is a master of his craft, capable of replicating any document, signature, or seal with terrifying accuracy. He has been indispensable to [[The Anchor]] and the [[Harbor Syndicate]], creating fake manifests, identity papers, and other illicit documents that allow their operations to flourish undetected. He largely operates in a hidden workshop within the [[Syndicate Warehouse]].

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Complete his current forging assignments flawlessly; acquire rare inks, papers, and tools for his craft.
### Long-term Goals
To maintain his valuable position within the Syndicate and continue refining his skills, possibly creating a masterpiece of forgery.
### Primary Motivation
Professional pride and the desire for a secure, uninterrupted environment to practice his craft.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** [[Harbor Syndicate]] (Key specialist)
* **Other Affiliations:** None, he is a solitary individual.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** His hidden workshop within the [[Syndicate Warehouse]].
* **Recent Events:** Is currently working on a highly sensitive set of documents for [[The Anchor]], which could have significant implications for the Syndicate's future.
* **Relevant Quests:** Can be a target for infiltration to acquire forged documents or to disrupt the Syndicate's ability to create them; could be coerced into forging documents for Vaelin.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** The Forger might inadvertently leave a clue about the Syndicate's next move in one of his forged documents; Vaelin could exploit his nervous nature to extract information; he might require Vaelin's aid in acquiring a rare component for a particularly difficult forgery.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
The Forger should be portrayed as twitchy and obsessed with details. His workshop should be filled with various tools, inks, and papers. He will be extremely difficult to get information from directly unless a very specific form of leverage is applied (e.g., threatening his tools or his precision).
