# The Forger

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Human
* **Gender:** Male
* **Age:** (approximate) 30s
* **Alignment:** Neutral Evil
* **Occupation:** Master Forger / Document Faker
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Minor
* **Disposition towards PC:** Neutral (purely transactional)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
The Forger is a nervous [[Human]] man in his 30s. His ink-stained hands and darting eyes betray his trade. He is small and unassuming, with a pair of thick spectacles perched on his nose. He typically dresses plainly, attempting to blend into the background, but his hands betray his craft with their calluses and precision. He often squints, as if constantly examining fine details.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Paranoid and meticulous, The Forger is obsessed with detail and highly skilled in his craft. He is generally timid outside of his work. He works under [[The Anchor]]â€™s pressure, loyal out of fear.
### Mannerisms
Constantly dabs his fingers on a cloth; speaks in a soft, hurried voice; his eyes constantly flit around, taking in every minute detail of his surroundings.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Perfection in deception is the ultimate art form."
**Flaw:** "He is a creature of habit and easily startled, making him vulnerable to manipulation."

## IV. Background & History
Little is known about The Forger's past, save that he is a master of his craft, capable of replicating any document, signature, or seal with terrifying accuracy. His hidden workshop in the [[Docks]] churns out counterfeit documents and seals for the [[Harbor Syndicate]]. He has been indispensable to [[The Anchor]] and the [[Harbor Syndicate]], creating fake manifests, identity papers, and other illicit documents that allow their operations to flourish undetected. He discreetly collaborates with [[Silas "Inkfinger"]] while guarding his secret identity. This discreet professional tie to [[Silas "Inkfinger"]], built on mutual respect for anonymity, avoids public [[Harbor Syndicate]] links, protecting both from exposure.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Complete his current forging assignments flawlessly; acquire rare inks, papers, and tools for his craft.
### Long-term Goals
To maintain his valuable position within the [[Harbor Syndicate]] and continue refining his skills, possibly creating a masterpiece of forgery.
### Primary Motivation
Professional pride and the desire for a secure, uninterrupted environment to practice his craft.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** [[Harbor Syndicate]] (Key specialist)
* **Other Affiliations:** Operates largely independently with a discreet professional tie to [[Silas "Inkfinger"]]. Also works for [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]] and other clients.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** His hidden workshop in the [[Docks]].
* **Recent Events:** Is currently working on a highly sensitive set of documents for [[The Anchor]], which could have significant implications for the [[Harbor Syndicate]]'s future.
* **Relevant Quests:** Can be a target for infiltration to acquire forged documents or to disrupt the [[Harbor Syndicate]]'s ability to create them; could be coerced into forging documents for [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]].
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** The Forger might inadvertently leave a clue about the [[Harbor Syndicate]]'s next move in one of his forged documents; [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]] could exploit his nervous nature to extract information; he might require [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s aid in acquiring a rare component for a particularly difficult forgery.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
The Forger should be portrayed as twitchy and obsessed with details. His workshop should be filled with various tools, inks, and papers. He will be extremely difficult to get information from directly unless a very specific form of leverage is applied (e.g., threatening his tools or his precision).
