## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Tarren is a burly [[Human]] man in his 40s. His scarred face and broad shoulders dominate the [[Drunken Raven]]’s door. His deep-set eyes miss little, and his fists enforce order. He wears simple, sturdy clothes that conceal his surprising strength.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Stoic and intimidating, Tarren speaks little. His [[Human]] endurance makes him a reliable gatekeeper. He is loyal to [[Talia "Whisper"]] and distrusts strangers.
### Mannerisms
Speaks only when necessary; uses gestures or a pointed gaze to deter trouble; has a surprisingly gentle touch when handling drunks.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Order and quiet are the only virtues in this world."
**Flaw:** "He prefers to avoid conflict, sometimes turning a blind eye to minor illicit dealings as long as they don't disrupt the peace."

## IV. Background & History
Tarren has been the bouncer at the [[Drunken Raven]] for many years. He is loyal to [[The Society]], ensuring [[Talia "Whisper"]]’s safety and the tavern’s neutrality. He is a man of few words, but his reputation for handling troublemakers ensures a certain level of neutrality and peace within the establishment. He has an unspoken understanding with [[Talia "Whisper"]], respecting her need for discretion, and recognizes [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]] as a trusted ally of hers.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Maintain order in the [[Drunken Raven]]; ensure a steady flow of patrons without drawing unwanted attention from the city guard or rival factions. Ensure [[Talia "Whisper"]]'s safety.
### Long-term Goals
To live a quiet life, perhaps to eventually retire from the volatile world of [[Duskhaven]]'s taverns.
### Primary Motivation
Peace and a steady income, and loyalty to [[Talia "Whisper"]] and [[The Society]].

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations

* **Other Affiliations:** Has professional acquaintances among various bar owners and bouncers in [[Duskhaven]].

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Primarily at the [[Drunken Raven]].
* **Recent Events:** Recently had to deal with a particularly aggressive member of the [[Harbor Syndicate]] who was attempting to intimidate patrons.
* **Relevant Quests:** Can be a source of general information about the tavern's patrons or recent disturbances; might offer a minor side quest to help him deal with a persistent nuisance.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Tarren could subtly warn [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]] about a dangerous individual entering the tavern; he might ask [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]] for a favor that inadvertently leads to a larger plot; his neutrality could be tested by a major faction conflict.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Tarren should be portrayed as a constant, reassuring presence for legitimate patrons, and a quiet but firm threat to troublemakers. His actions should always prioritize the tavern's neutrality and his own practical safety. He will not engage in conversation beyond what is necessary. His loyalty to [[Talia "Whisper"]] is a key aspect.
