# Tarren

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Human
* **Gender:** Male
* **Age:** (approximate) 30s
* **Alignment:** Neutral
* **Occupation:** Bouncer
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Minor
* **Disposition towards PC:** Indifferent (as long as they don't cause trouble)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Tarren is a broad, grizzled man with a weathered face and a scar running along his jawline. He has a quiet but imposing presence, often seen leaning against the doorframe or observing the common room with a stoic expression. He wears simple, sturdy clothes that conceal his surprising strength.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Stoic, observant, pragmatic, and highly effective at maintaining order.
### Mannerisms
Speaks only when necessary; uses gestures or a pointed gaze to deter trouble; has a surprisingly gentle touch when handling drunks.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Order and quiet are the only virtues in this world."
**Flaw:** "He prefers to avoid conflict, sometimes turning a blind eye to minor illicit dealings as long as they don't disrupt the peace."

## IV. Background & History
Tarren has been the bouncer at the [[Drunken Raven]] for many years, seemingly uninterested in the covert activities that often take place within its walls. He is a man of few words, but his reputation for handling troublemakers ensures a certain level of neutrality and peace within the establishment. He has an unspoken understanding with [[Talia "Whisper"]], respecting her need for discretion.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Maintain order in the Drunken Raven; ensure a steady flow of patrons without drawing unwanted attention from the city guard or rival factions.
### Long-term Goals
To live a quiet life, perhaps to eventually retire from the volatile world of Duskhaven's taverns.
### Primary Motivation
Peace and a steady income.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** None (maintains strict neutrality for the tavern)
* **Other Affiliations:** Has professional acquaintances among various bar owners and bouncers in Duskhaven.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Primarily at the [[Drunken Raven]].
* **Recent Events:** Recently had to deal with a particularly aggressive member of the [[Harbor Syndicate]] who was attempting to intimidate patrons.
* **Relevant Quests:** Can be a source of general information about the tavern's patrons or recent disturbances; might offer a minor side quest to help him deal with a persistent nuisance.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Tarren could subtly warn Vaelin about a dangerous individual entering the tavern; he might ask Vaelin for a favor that inadvertently leads to a larger plot; his neutrality could be tested by a major faction conflict.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Tarren should be a constant, reassuring presence for legitimate patrons, and a quiet but firm threat to troublemakers. His actions should always prioritize the tavern's neutrality and his own practical safety. He will not engage in conversation beyond what is necessary.
