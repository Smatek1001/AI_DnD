# Silas "Inkfinger"

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Gnome
* **Gender:** Male
* **Age:** (approximate) Late 50s
* **Alignment:** Neutral
* **Occupation:** Independent Forger / Alchemist
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Supporting
* **Disposition towards PC:** Neutral (professional rapport, pragmatic)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Silas is a sprightly Gnome in his late 50s. He has twinkling blue eyes and a shock of white hair. His ink-stained fingers dance over alchemical tools. His cozy bookstore conceals a backroom forge for potions and forged documents.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Paranoid but ingenious, Silas trusts few. His gnomish cunning and curiosity drive his craft. He navigates [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]â€™s elite with a clever facade, valuing coin over loyalty, but honors his professional rapport with [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]].
### Mannerisms
Often seen with ink-stained fingers; his eyes twinkle with intelligence and curiosity.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Knowledge, carefully guarded, is the greatest treasure, and alchemy is its key."
**Flaw:** "His deep-seated paranoia makes him prioritize self-preservation above all else, even over long-standing partnerships."

## IV. Background & History
Silas "Inkfinger" operates a seemingly innocuous bookstore in the [[Locations/Noble_District|Noble District]], but his true expertise lies in the hidden backroom forge where he crafts potions and forges documents. He is an independent operator, but maintains a discreet collaboration with [[Characters/NPCs/The_Forger|The Forger]] for the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]]. He has built a professional rapport with [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] over years of mutual profit. He discreetly collaborates with [[Characters/NPCs/Silas_Inkfinger|Silas "Inkfinger"]] while guarding his secret identity. This discreet professional tie to Silas, built on mutual respect for anonymity, avoids public Syndicate links, protecting both from exposure.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Complete current forging and alchemical commissions; acquire rare inks, papers, and tools for his craft.
### Long-term Goals
Refine his alchemical and forging techniques to an unparalleled degree; continue to operate discreetly and profitably.
### Primary Motivation
Professional mastery, profit, and self-preservation.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** None (Independent)
* **Other Affiliations:** Has a discreet professional tie to [[Characters/NPCs/The_Forger|The Forger]] for the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]]. Also works for [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] and other clients.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** His bookstore and backroom forge in the [[Locations/Noble_District|Noble District]].
* **Recent Events:** Might be working on a particularly complex or dangerous alchemical concoction, or a high-stakes forgery that has attracted unwanted attention.
* **Relevant Quests:** A source for forged documents, rare alchemical potions, and discreet information concerning the [[Locations/Noble_District|Noble District]] or high-society secrets.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Silas might need [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s help to acquire a rare alchemical ingredient; he could be pressured by a major faction (like the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]) to betray his clients, forcing [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] to intervene; [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] might seek him out for a difficult forgery related to his past or a mission.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Silas should be portrayed as twitchy and highly observant. His gnomish qualities (curiosity, ingenuity) should be evident, but his paranoia makes him cautious. His loyalty is transactional, making him a complex ally. If pressured, he would prioritize self-preservation over his partnership with [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]].
