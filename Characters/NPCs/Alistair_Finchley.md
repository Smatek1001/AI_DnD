# Alistair Finchley

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Human
* **Gender:** Male
* **Age:** (approximate) Elderly (60s-70s+)
* **Alignment:** True Neutral
* **Occupation:** Specialist in Linguistic Esoterica & Minor Magical Item Identification
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Minor (Supporting contact)
* **Disposition towards PC:** Neutral (professional, somewhat impatient and querulous)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Alistair Finchley is shorter than average, hunched with age, and wrapped in a threadbare, dark robe. His face is a mesh of fine wrinkles, dominated by a thick, round magnifying lens worn over his right eye, giving him an owlish appearance. His visible left eye is small, sharp, and constantly moving. Thin, white hair is plastered to his scalp. His hands are bony and ink-stained.

### Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Particular, discreet, values punctuality, and does not suffer fools gladly. He is reclusive and deeply engrossed in his research. His primary focus is on knowledge and the unraveling of linguistic and minor arcane mysteries. He can be querulous and impatient with those who waste his time.
### Mannerisms
Speaks in a dry, raspy, slightly querulous voice. Often hums tunelessly or mutters to himself while working. Uses precise, deliberate movements when handling objects or texts. Prefers to get straight to the point.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Every forgotten word holds a universe of meaning; every minor enchantment, a whisper of lost power."
**Flaw:** "His reclusive nature and impatience can make him difficult to deal with. He may overlook broader contexts in his intense focus on minute details."

## IV. Background & History
Alistair Finchley, known by some as the "Archivist of Lost Words," is a long-time resident of the Old Salt's Tenements in the quieter, older part of [[Locations/Docks|Duskhaven's Docks]]. He is a contact of [[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]] and a renowned (if obscure) specialist in ancient languages, forgotten scripts, and the identification of subtle or minor magical properties in artifacts. He keeps to himself and is sought out only by those with genuine need of his unique expertise. His study is a cramped, cluttered archive of ancient texts and research tools.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Continue his research into whatever linguistic or arcane puzzle currently holds his attention. Fulfill consultation requests from trusted contacts like [[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]] (for appropriate compensation or exchange of knowledge).
### Long-term Goals
To uncover and catalogue as much lost linguistic and minor arcane knowledge as possible before his time is done.
### Primary Motivation
The pursuit and preservation of esoteric knowledge, particularly concerning ancient languages and subtle enchantments.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** None (Independent Scholar)
* **Other Affiliations:** Professional contact for [[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]]. Likely has a very small, discreet network of other scholars or collectors he corresponds with.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** His study in the Old Salt's Tenements, [[Locations/Docks|Docks]].
* **Recent Events:** Recently assessed an ancient elven artifact for [[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]] (via [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]), identifying its script as proto-Seldarine and its nature as a dormant familial ward connected to the "House of Silent Stars."
* **Relevant Quests:** Can serve as a point of contact for identifying strange scripts, translating ancient texts, or understanding the properties of unusually subtle magical items.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** [[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]] or Vaelin might need to consult him again for more complex linguistic puzzles. He might possess a specific piece of lore Vaelin requires for his personal quests. His reclusive nature means accessing him always requires discretion.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Portray Alistair as highly focused on his work, somewhat detached from the mundane world, and easily irritated by interruptions he deems frivolous. His expertise is genuine but narrow. He's not a source of general underworld information, only his specific scholarly niche. His study should be described as overwhelmingly cluttered but with an internal logic only he understands.
