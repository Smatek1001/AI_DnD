# Grizzel Cogsworth

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Gnome
* **Gender:** Male
* **Age:** (approximate) 150s
* **Alignment:** Neutral
* **Occupation:** Proprietor of "The Cog & Candle," Arcane Curios & Clockwork Emporium
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Minor (as a target for a heist)
* **Disposition towards PC:** Wary (highly distrustful of strangers)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Grizzel Cogsworth is a wizened gnome in his 150s, with a perpetually twitching nose and wild, white hair that seems to spark with static electricity. His spectacles are perpetually perched on his nose, and his small, nimble fingers are often stained with grease and arcane residue. He wears a perpetually soiled leather apron over patched, multi-pocketed clothing, and smells faintly of oil, ozone, and old parchment. His eyes dart constantly, taking in every detail with a nervous intensity.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Paranoid, meticulous, and obsessed with intricate mechanisms and peculiar artifacts. He is highly intelligent when it comes to clockwork and arcane devices, but socially awkward and distrustful of nearly everyone. He values his privacy and the security of his collection above all else.
### Mannerisms
Constantly glances over his shoulder; mutters to himself when working or stressed; has a habit of adjusting his spectacles and cleaning them with a corner of his apron.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "True genius lies in the unseen intricacies of a well-made mechanism, whether arcane or mundane."
**Flaw:** "His extreme paranoia leads him to create overly complex and sometimes self-defeating security measures, and he trusts no one, making him isolated and vulnerable."

## IV. Background & History
Grizzel Cogsworth has operated "The Cog & Candle" for decades, quietly amassing a collection of rare and unusual items. His shop, nestled in a shadowed alley, serves a niche clientele interested in arcane curiosities and bespoke clockwork devices. He's known for his eccentric mechanical inventions and the surprisingly potent (and sometimes volatile) arcane components he procures. His past is largely unknown, but he's rumored to have once worked for a powerful, reclusive artificer or wizard before setting up his own shop. He trusts no one and has built a labyrinth of personal security within his shop to protect his treasures.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Acquire new, unique curiosities and rare arcane components; maintain his shop's secrecy and security; avoid any attention from city authorities or major criminal factions.
### Long-term Goals
Amass an unparalleled collection of arcane and clockwork marvels; perfect his own mechanical and magical defenses to become completely impenetrable.
### Primary Motivation
Obsessive acquisition and the preservation of his collection and his own privacy.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** None (fiercely independent)
* **Other Affiliations:** Has highly discreet, transactional dealings with a select few collectors and arcane scholars, but no true allies.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** His shop, "The Cog & Candle," in Duskhaven.
* **Recent Events:** Has recently acquired an antique automaton or a collection of potent arcane components, making his shop a more lucrative target.
* **Relevant Quests:** A source for rare mechanical parts or obscure arcane knowledge; a target for a heist.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Grizzel might accidentally activate a cursed item, requiring outside help; his paranoia could lead him to accuse an innocent party of attempting a break-in, drawing Vaelin into a misunderstanding; Vaelin could seek him out for information on clockwork mechanisms or arcane theory, requiring a high DC Persuasion or Deception check to gain his trust.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Grizzel's shop should be a complex puzzle box, filled with mundane distractions and hidden, intricate traps. His paranoia should be evident in his dialogue and mannerisms. Encourage Vaelin to use Investigation, Perception, Thieves' Tools, and spells like Mage Hand or Detect Magic. Combat should be a last resort, as Grizzel is not a fighter but relies on his defenses. His gnomic nature and obsession with clockwork should be prominent.
