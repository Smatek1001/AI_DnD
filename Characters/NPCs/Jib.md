# Jib

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Halfling
* **Gender:** Male
* **Age:** (approximate) 20s
* **Alignment:** Neutral Evil
* **Occupation:** Nightshade Guild Lookout
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Minor
* **Disposition towards PC:** Wary (initially suspicious)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Jib is a small Halfling man in his 20s. His keen ears and squinting green eyes mark him as a sharp lookout. Perched on crates in the east alley, his heavy cloak hides a crossbow and [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]] sigil. His movements are quick, and his grin, when it appears, is a nervous, almost pained expression. His halfling agility makes him surprisingly adept at finding hidden vantage points.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Suspicious and attentive, Jib is highly observant and quick-witted. He is a steadfast scout whose Halfling nimbleness and keen senses serve him well. Loyal to [[Characters/NPCs/Vrenna|Vrenna]], heâ€™s quick to report threats.
### Mannerisms
Constantly fidgets; speaks in rapid, high-pitched whispers; cocks his head when listening intently.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "See everything, say nothing, survive another day."
**Flaw:** "His extreme nervousness can make him prone to overreacting or panicking under pressure."

## IV. Background & History
Jib, a Halfling with an unusual sensitivity to arcane energies, found a place within the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]] due to his unique talents as a lookout. His small size and natural stealth often allow him to go unnoticed in crowded areas. He often works alongside [[Characters/NPCs/Kyssra|Kyssra]], covering the approaches to the [[Locations/Whispering_Door|Whispering Door]] and ensuring the Guild's operations remain undetected. His heightened senses make him invaluable for the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]'s covert operations.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Avoid detection, accurately report anything unusual, and stay out of trouble.
### Long-term Goals
Survive in the dangerous world of [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]'s underworld; perhaps gain enough favor to secure a less exposed position within the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]].
### Primary Motivation
Self-preservation and a desire for stability.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]] (Specialized Lookout)
* **Other Affiliations:** None specific.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Stationed at various vantage points around the [[Locations/Whispering_Door|Whispering Door]], particularly where arcane activity might be a concern.
* **Recent Events:** Has reported an unusual surge of low-level arcane energy near the [[Locations/Veil|Veil]] district, potentially indicating a new threat or a powerful ritual.
* **Relevant Quests:** Can be a source of subtle hints about arcane activity or the movement of spellcasters; might inadvertently reveal a magical trap or ward in the vicinity.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Jib might be the first to notice a powerful spellcaster attempting to infiltrate the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]'s territory; [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] might need to exploit Jib's nervous nature to bypass his watch; Jib could be a target for a rival faction seeking to neutralize the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]'s magical detection capabilities.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Jib's nervousness should be palpable, but it stems from his hyper-awareness, not cowardice. His observations might be delivered in a rapid, almost frantic manner. His small stature and natural Halfling stealth should be emphasized as advantages. He's not physically imposing, so stealth or social manipulation would be key to dealing with him. His sensitivity to magic should be a recurring, subtle element.
