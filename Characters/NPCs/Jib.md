# Jib

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Halfling
* **Gender:** Male
* **Age:** (approximate) 20s
* **Alignment:** Neutral Evil
* **Occupation:** Nightshade Guild Lookout
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Minor
* **Disposition towards PC:** Wary (initially suspicious)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Jib is a small [[Halfling]] man in his 20s. His keen ears and squinting green eyes mark him as a sharp lookout. Perched on crates in the east alley, his heavy cloak hides a crossbow and [[Nightshade Guild]] sigil. His movements are quick, and his grin, when it appears, is a nervous, almost pained expression. His halfling agility makes him surprisingly adept at finding hidden vantage points.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Suspicious and attentive, Jib is highly observant and quick-witted. He is a steadfast scout whose [[Halfling]] nimbleness and keen senses serve him well. Loyal to [[Vrenna]], heâ€™s quick to report threats.
### Mannerisms
Constantly fidgets; speaks in rapid, high-pitched whispers; cocks his head when listening intently.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "See everything, say nothing, survive another day."
**Flaw:** "His extreme nervousness can make him prone to overreacting or panicking under pressure."

## IV. Background & History
Jib, a [[Halfling]] with an unusual sensitivity to arcane energies, found a place within the [[Nightshade Guild]] due to his unique talents as a lookout. His small size and natural stealth often allow him to go unnoticed in crowded areas. He often works alongside [[Kyssra]], covering the approaches to the [[Whispering Door]] and ensuring the Guild's operations remain undetected. His heightened senses make him invaluable for the [[Nightshade Guild]]'s covert operations.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Avoid detection, accurately report anything unusual, and stay out of trouble.
### Long-term Goals
Survive in the dangerous world of [[Duskhaven]]'s underworld; perhaps gain enough favor to secure a less exposed position within the [[Nightshade Guild]].
### Primary Motivation
Self-preservation and a desire for stability.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** [[Nightshade Guild]] (Specialized Lookout)
* **Other Affiliations:** None specific.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Stationed at various vantage points around the [[Whispering Door]], particularly where arcane activity might be a concern.
* **Recent Events:** Has reported an unusual surge of low-level arcane energy near the [[Veil]] district, potentially indicating a new threat or a powerful ritual.
* **Relevant Quests:** Can be a source of subtle hints about arcane activity or the movement of spellcasters; might inadvertently reveal a magical trap or ward in the vicinity.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Jib might be the first to notice a powerful spellcaster attempting to infiltrate the [[Nightshade Guild]]'s territory; [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]] might need to exploit Jib's nervous nature to bypass his watch; Jib could be a target for a rival faction seeking to neutralize the [[Nightshade Guild]]'s magical detection capabilities.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Jib's nervousness should be palpable, but it stems from his hyper-awareness, not cowardice. His observations might be delivered in a rapid, almost frantic manner. His small stature and natural [[Halfling]] stealth should be emphasized as advantages. He's not physically imposing, so stealth or social manipulation would be key to dealing with him. His sensitivity to magic should be a recurring, subtle element.
