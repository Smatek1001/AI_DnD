# Elaris

## I. Overview
* **Race:** High Elf
* **Gender:** Female
* **Age:** (approximate) Appears 30s (likely much older)
* **Alignment:** Neutral
* **Occupation:** Arcane Shop Proprietor (Shaded Lantern)
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Supporting
* **Disposition towards PC:** Neutral (purely transactional, values knowledge above all else)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Elaris is a slender High Elf with keen, ancient eyes that seem to hold centuries of knowledge. Her silver-blonde hair is often intricately braided, and she moves with a quiet, almost ethereal grace among the cluttered shelves of her shop. She wears elegant, but practical, robes that seem to shimmer faintly in the shop's dim, magical light. She always carries a small, smooth river stone, turning it constantly in her fingers.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Quietly intelligent, immensely knowledgeable in arcane lore, patient, and highly observant. She rarely offers information freely.
### Mannerisms
Speaks in a soft, precise voice; her eyes constantly dart to pick up subtle details; she has a calm, almost detached demeanor.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "True knowledge is the path to understanding the universe, regardless of its moral implications."
**Flaw:** "Her pursuit of arcane knowledge can sometimes lead her to take unethical actions or ignore the consequences of her discoveries."

## IV. Background & History
Elaris is a long-standing resident of the [[Veil]] district, a High Elf whose age is difficult to discern but whose knowledge suggests a long life dedicated to arcane study. She inherited the [[Shaded Lantern]] and has built its reputation as a discreet source for rare magical components and esoteric lore. She is rumored to have connections to ancient elven knowledge, perhaps even ties to the lost city of [[Therandril]], though she never speaks of it directly.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Acquire rare and unique arcane components and texts; secure her position as the premier arcane supplier in Duskhaven.
### Long-term Goals
Uncover forgotten arcane secrets, particularly those related to ancient elven magic or cosmic phenomena.
### Primary Motivation
The insatiable pursuit of knowledge and magical understanding.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** None (fiercely independent)
* **Other Affiliations:** Has transactional relationships with various arcane practitioners, collectors, and even cautious members of [[The Society]] or [[Nightshade Guild]] seeking specific magical resources.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Always at the [[Shaded Lantern]].
* **Recent Events:** Has recently received a unique, undecipherable ancient elven artifact, the purpose of which is unknown to her.
* **Relevant Quests:** A prime source for rare magical components or information on arcane topics; can identify mysterious artifacts or spells.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Elaris might offer Vaelin a quest to retrieve a missing piece of arcane lore; her knowledge of ancient elven history might provide a crucial clue to Vaelin's past or [[Therandril]]; her shop could become a target for those seeking rare magical items, requiring Vaelin's intervention.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Elaris should be portrayed as ancient and wise, with a detached curiosity. Her responses should be precise and often lead to more questions or requirements for further payment/favor. Her subtle hints about ancient elven lore should be intriguing to Vaelin. She's not a friend, but a valuable resource.
