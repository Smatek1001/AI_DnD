# Elaris

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Elf
* **Gender:** Female
* **Age:** (approximate) 100s
* **Alignment:** Neutral
* **Occupation:** Independent Arcane Sage
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Supporting
* **Disposition towards PC:** Neutral (tentative alliance, wary)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Elaris is a lean elf woman in her 100s. Her emerald eyes and flowing auburn hair shimmer with arcane energy. Her tattered robes belie her mastery of Draconic lore. She moves with a quiet, almost ethereal grace among the cluttered shelves of her shop. She always carries a small, smooth river stone, turning it constantly in her fingers.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Erudite but secretive, Elaris seeks knowledge over power. Her elven curiosity drives her research. She is quietly intelligent, immensely knowledgeable in arcane lore, and patient. She aids [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]] for mutual gain, wary of [[The Society]] ties.
### Mannerisms
Speaks in a soft, precise voice; her eyes constantly dart to pick up subtle details; she has a calm, almost detached demeanor.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "True knowledge is the path to understanding the universe, regardless of its moral implications."
**Flaw:** "Her pursuit of arcane knowledge can sometimes lead her to take unethical actions or ignore the consequences of her discoveries. She is wary of committing to deeper relationships."

## IV. Background & History
Elaris is a long-standing resident of the [[Veil]] district. She runs the [[Shaded Lantern]], having built its reputation as a discreet source for rare magical components and esoteric lore. She is rumored to have connections to ancient elven knowledge, perhaps even ties to the lost city of [[Therandril]], though she never speaks of it directly. She has a tentative alliance with [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]], working together for mutual gain in arcane research. She values his assistance in uncovering relics but remains cautious due to his Society ties, keeping their relationship professional rather than deeply personal.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Acquire rare and unique arcane components and texts; secure her position as the premier arcane supplier in [[Duskhaven]].
### Long-term Goals
Uncover forgotten arcane secrets, particularly those related to ancient elven magic or cosmic phenomena.
### Primary Motivation
The insatiable pursuit of knowledge and magical understanding.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** None (fiercely independent)
* **Other Affiliations:** Has transactional relationships with various arcane practitioners, collectors, and even cautious members of [[The Society]] or [[Nightshade Guild]] seeking specific magical resources.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Always at the [[Shaded Lantern]].
* **Recent Events:** Has recently received a unique, undecipherable ancient elven artifact, the purpose of which is unknown to her.
* **Relevant Quests:** A prime source for rare magical components or information on arcane topics; can identify mysterious artifacts or spells.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Elaris might offer [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]] a quest to retrieve a missing piece of arcane lore related to Draconic studies; her knowledge of ancient elven history might provide a crucial clue to Vaelin's past or [[Therandril]]; her shop could become a target for those seeking rare magical items, requiring Vaelin's intervention.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Elaris should be portrayed as ancient and wise, with a detached curiosity. Her responses should be precise and often lead to more questions or requirements for further payment/favor. Her subtle hints about ancient elven lore should be intriguing to Vaelin. She's not a friend, but a valuable resource. Her wariness of the Society is a key element.
