# Elaris

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Elf
* **Gender:** Female
* **Age:** (approximate) 100s
* **Alignment:** Neutral
* **Occupation:** Independent Arcane Sage
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Supporting
* **Disposition towards PC:** professional_alliance (formerly tentative alliance, wary; now solidified through mutual benefit)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Elaris is a lean [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Elf_Race_2024|Elf]] woman in her 100s. Her emerald eyes and flowing auburn hair shimmer with arcane energy. Her tattered robes belie her mastery of Draconic lore. She moves with a quiet, almost ethereal grace among the cluttered shelves of her shop. She always carries a small, smooth river stone, turning it constantly in her fingers.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Erudite but secretive, Elaris seeks knowledge over power. Her elven curiosity drives her research. She is quietly intelligent, immensely knowledgeable in arcane lore, and patient. She aids [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] for mutual gain, wary of [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]] ties.
### Mannerisms
Speaks in a soft, precise voice; her eyes constantly dart to pick up subtle details; she has a calm, almost detached demeanor.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "True knowledge is the path to understanding the universe, regardless of its moral implications."
**Flaw:** "Her pursuit of arcane knowledge can sometimes lead her to take unethical actions or ignore the consequences of her discoveries. She is wary of committing to deeper relationships."

## IV. Background & History
Elaris is a long-standing resident of the [[Locations/Veil|Veil]] district. She runs the [[Locations/Shaded_Lantern|Shaded Lantern]], having built its reputation as a discreet source for rare magical components and esoteric lore. She is rumored to have connections to ancient elven knowledge, perhaps even ties to the lost city of [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]], though she never speaks of it directly. She has a tentative alliance with [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]], working together for mutual gain in arcane research. She values his assistance in uncovering relics but remains cautious due to his [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]] ties, keeping their relationship professional rather than deeply personal. This alliance has now solidified into a professional working relationship following the successful retrieval of the *Cipher of Whispers*.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Acquire rare and unique arcane components and texts; secure her position as the premier arcane supplier in [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]].
### Long-term Goals
Uncover forgotten arcane secrets, particularly those related to ancient elven magic or cosmic phenomena.
### Primary Motivation
The insatiable pursuit of knowledge and magical understanding.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** None (fiercely independent)
* **Other Affiliations:** Has transactional relationships with various arcane practitioners, collectors, and even cautious members of [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]] or [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]] seeking specific magical resources.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Always at the [[Locations/Shaded_Lantern|Shaded Lantern]].
* **Recent Events:** Recently had [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] retrieve an assessment from [[Characters/NPCs/Alistair_Finchley|Alistair Finchley]] regarding an ancient elven artifact, learning it relates to the 'House of Silent Stars.' She will now research this further.
* **Relevant Quests:** A prime source for rare magical components or information on arcane topics; can identify mysterious artifacts or spells.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Elaris might offer [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] further quests to retrieve missing pieces of arcane lore related to Draconic studies or [[Lore/Cosmology/The_Nameless_Void|The Nameless Void]]; her knowledge of ancient elven history might provide a crucial clue to [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s past or [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]]; her shop could become a target for those seeking rare magical items, requiring [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s intervention. May have future work for Vaelin related to the '[[Quests/Completed/The_Archivists_Appraisal|House of Silent Stars]]' or other findings from the artifact's assessment. Has promised to procure/craft a lead-lined chest for Vaelin.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Elaris should be portrayed as ancient and wise, with a detached curiosity. Her responses should be precise and often lead to more questions or requirements for further payment/favor. Her subtle hints about ancient elven lore should be intriguing to [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]. She's not a friend, but a valuable resource. Her wariness of [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]] is a key element. Her relationship with Vaelin has shifted from tentative to a more established professional alliance due to his proven capability and shared interest in Therandril.

Let's retcon Elaris a little. She did **NOT** know anything about Vaelin, his name, his tattoo, or anything else about him before he [[Session_Logs/2025/05-May/2025-05-29_The_Cipher_of_Whispers_Completion_&_Study|walked into her shop]] to get the [[Quests/Completed/The_Cipher_of_Whispers|Cipher of Whispers quest]]. She now knows of his connection to [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]] as a survivor of its destruction as a child, but still doesn't know about his tattoo or the amulet.
