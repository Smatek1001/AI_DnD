# Skarlix

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Goblin
* **Gender:** Male
* **Age:** (approximate) 40s
* **Alignment:** Lawful Evil
* **Occupation:** Loan Shark
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Minor (but pivotal to certain Docks operations)
* **Disposition towards PC:** Indifferent (unless the PC interferes with his business)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Skarlix is a gaunt goblin with a perpetual sneer etched into his wrinkled green face, his small, beady eyes sharp and calculating. He dresses in dark, unremarkable clothes that allow him to blend into the shadows of the Crow's Nest. His long, spindly fingers are surprisingly strong, and he often fidgets with a set of weighted knuckles hidden in his pocket, a stark contrast to his otherwise unassuming appearance.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Calculating, cold, patient, and utterly ruthless when it comes to collecting debts.
### Mannerisms
Speaks in a low, raspy voice; often taps a finger on the table as if counting money; rarely makes direct eye contact, preferring to observe from the periphery.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Every coin earned is a coin of power, and every debt owed is a leash."
**Flaw:** "He underestimates loyalty, believing everyone has a price."

## IV. Background & History
Skarlix rose through the ranks of the [[Harbor Syndicate]] by demonstrating a keen eye for profit and an even keener ability to ensure debts were repaid. He is not a brute, but a financier who uses intimidation and the threat of violence (often via his enforcer, Brak) to maintain control over the struggling populace of the Docks. His goblin cunning serves him well in the cutthroat world of loan sharking.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Collect outstanding debts, expand his loan sharking operation, and identify new marks.
### Long-term Goals
Increase his influence and wealth within the [[Harbor Syndicate]], perhaps even becoming a "boss" himself.
### Primary Motivation
Greed and control.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** [[Harbor Syndicate]] (Key operator of their loan sharking division)
* **Other Affiliations:** None significant beyond his direct Syndicate ties.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Primarily at the [[Crow's Nest]], overseeing his operations.
* **Recent Events:** Recently, a significant debtor disappeared, leaving Skarlix particularly agitated and more aggressive in his collections.
* **Relevant Quests:** Could be a source of information on Docks' underworld dealings, or a target for a retrieval/sabotage mission against the Syndicate.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Skarlix could offer a desperate PC a "loan" with impossible terms; he might put a bounty on the missing debtor, leading Vaelin into a deeper mystery; he could be a source of conflict if the PC interferes with his collections.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Skarlix should be portrayed as a man who wields quiet power. His threats are rarely loud but always carry weight. He should have Brak nearby for any physical enforcement. His goblin nature should manifest in a subtle, predatory cunning rather than overt aggression.
