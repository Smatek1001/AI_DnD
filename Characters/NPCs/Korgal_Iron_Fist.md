# Korgal Iron Fist

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Half-Orc
* **Gender:** Male
* **Age:** (approximate) 40s
* **Alignment:** Lawful Evil
* **Occupation:** Harbor Syndicate Enforcer
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Minor
* **Disposition towards PC:** Hostile (especially if they are a threat to Syndicate operations)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Korgal is a towering, muscular half-orc with a grim expression and a perpetually scowling face, accented by a prominent lower jaw and small tusks. His most notable feature is a heavy, steel-plated gauntlet on his right hand, which he often clenches into a formidable fist. He has a shaved head and a brutal scar across his left eye. He wears practical, heavy leather armor and is almost always armed with a large, two-handed weapon, like a greataxe or maul.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Brutal, loyal, humorless, and utterly dedicated to the [[Harbor Syndicate]] and [[The Anchor]]. He is a man of action, not words.
### Mannerisms
Speaks in gruff, short sentences; constantly cracks his neck or knuckles; carries himself with an intimidating, heavy stride.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Loyalty to the Syndicate is the only code that matters."
**Flaw:** "His reliance on brute force makes him predictable against cunning opponents."

## IV. Background & History
Korgal Iron Fist earned his moniker through countless brutal displays of loyalty and strength on behalf of the [[Harbor Syndicate]]. His half-orc strength and ferocity make him an ideal enforcer. He serves as [[The Anchor]]'s most trusted enforcer, tasked with intimidating rivals, punishing traitors, and securing valuable shipments. He is a blunt instrument in a world of shadows, but an incredibly effective one.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Execute [[The Anchor]]'s orders; eliminate any threats to Syndicate operations; ensure the security of the [[Syndicate Warehouse]].
### Long-term Goals
Continue serving [[The Anchor]], rising further as a powerful figure within the Syndicate's enforcement arm.
### Primary Motivation
Loyalty, and the satisfaction of dominating those who oppose the Syndicate.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** [[Harbor Syndicate]] (Primary Enforcer for The Anchor)
* **Other Affiliations:** Leads various groups of Syndicate thugs.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Often found patrolling the [[Syndicate Warehouse]], personally overseeing security, or on high-value enforcement missions.
* **Recent Events:** Has been particularly vigilant and aggressive recently, personally investigating any breaches in Syndicate security.
* **Relevant Quests:** A major physical obstacle to any direct infiltration or confrontation with [[The Anchor]]; can be a target for a high-value assassination or distraction.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Korgal might be leading a raid on a rival gang's hideout, presenting an opportunity for Vaelin to intervene or exploit; he might be transporting a valuable item that Vaelin needs to intercept; he could be a direct threat if Vaelin is discovered.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Korgal should be portrayed as a formidable physical threat. His presence alone should be intimidating. He is not subtle and will react to threats with direct, brutal force. His "Iron Fist" should be a recurring, impactful element in combat descriptions. His half-orc nature should emphasize his raw strength and tenacity.
