# Korgal Iron Fist

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Half-Orc
* **Gender:** Male
* **Age:** (approximate) 40s
* **Alignment:** Lawful Evil
* **Occupation:** Harbor Syndicate Chief Lieutenant / Enforcer
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Minor
* **Disposition towards PC:** Hostile (especially if they are a threat to Syndicate operations)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Korgal is a towering [[Half-Orc]] in his 40s. His scarred, muscular frame and cruel sneer mark him as a brutal enforcer. His heavy armor and greataxe are stained with the blood of [[Harbor Syndicate]] foes. He has a shaved head and a brutal scar across his left eye. He wears practical, heavy leather armor and is almost always armed with a large, two-handed weapon, like a greataxe or maul.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Cruel and unrelenting, Korgal revels in intimidation. His [[Half-Orc]] strength and Relentless Endurance make him a fearsome foe. He is loyal to [[The Anchor]] for power. He is brutal, humorless, and utterly dedicated to the [[Harbor Syndicate]].
### Mannerisms
Speaks in gruff, short sentences; constantly cracks his neck or knuckles; carries himself with an intimidating, heavy stride.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Loyalty to the [[Harbor Syndicate]] is the only code that matters."
**Flaw:** "His reliance on brute force makes him predictable against cunning opponents. His temper is a weakness."

## IV. Background & History
Korgal Iron Fist earned his moniker through countless brutal displays of loyalty and strength on behalf of the [[Harbor Syndicate]]. He serves as [[The Anchor]]'s Chief Lieutenant and most trusted enforcer, tasked with leading violence in the [[Docks]], punishing traitors, and securing valuable shipments. He also oversees couriers like [[Skrix]]. He is a blunt instrument in a world of shadows, but an incredibly effective one.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Execute [[The Anchor]]'s orders; eliminate any threats to [[Harbor Syndicate]] operations; ensure the security of the [[Syndicate Warehouse]].
### Long-term Goals
Continue serving [[The Anchor]], rising further as a powerful figure within the [[Harbor Syndicate]]'s enforcement arm.
### Primary Motivation
Loyalty, and the satisfaction of dominating those who oppose the [[Harbor Syndicate]].

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** [[Harbor Syndicate]] (Chief Lieutenant / Primary Enforcer for [[The Anchor]])
* **Other Affiliations:** Leads various groups of [[Harbor Syndicate]] thugs.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Often found patrolling the [[Syndicate Warehouse]], personally overseeing security, or on high-value enforcement missions.
* **Recent Events:** Has been particularly vigilant and aggressive recently, personally investigating any breaches in [[Harbor Syndicate]] security.
* **Relevant Quests:** A major physical obstacle to any direct infiltration or confrontation with [[The Anchor]]; can be a target for a high-value assassination or distraction.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Korgal might be leading a raid on a rival gang's hideout, presenting an opportunity for [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] to intervene or exploit; he might be transporting a valuable item that [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] needs to intercept; he could be a direct threat if [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] is discovered.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Korgal should be portrayed as a formidable physical threat. His presence alone should be intimidating. He is not subtle and will react to threats with direct, brutal force. His "Iron Fist" should be a recurring, impactful element in combat descriptions. His [[Half-Orc]] nature should emphasize his raw strength and tenacity.
