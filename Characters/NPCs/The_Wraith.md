## I. Overview

* **Gender:** Unknown
* **Age:** (approximate) Unknown
* **Alignment:** Lawful Evil
* **Occupation:** Guildmaster of the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Pivotal
* **Disposition towards PC:** Hostile

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
The Wraith is a shadowy [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Elf_Race_2024#B. Drow|Drow]] figure cloaked in black. Their glowing red eyes pierce the [[Locations/Veil|Veil]]â€™s fog. Their form is often indistinct, seeming to blend with the shadows. Their true features are rarely seen clearly.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Enigmatic and merciless, The Wraith rules through fear. Their [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Elf_Race_2024#B. Drow|Drow]] cunning and magical affinity make them untouchable. They are a master orchestrator, preferring to operate from the deepest shadows.
### Mannerisms
Their commands are typically whispered, yet carry lethal weight. Their presence is often felt more than seen.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Absolute control over the shadows and all illicit trade within [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]."
**Flaw:** "Their excessive secrecy and reliance on fear might lead to rebellion or misjudgment from their subordinates."

## IV. Background & History
The Wraith is the mysterious and feared Guildmaster of the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]], orchestrating its vast network of espionage and heists from the deepest parts of the [[Locations/Veil|Veil]]. Their past is a complete enigma, even to most within the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]], but their authority is unquestioned, enforced by ruthless efficiency and a reputation for unseen retribution. Their [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Elf_Race_2024#B. Drow|Drow]] heritage provides an innate affinity for shadows and subtle magic.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Secure dominance for the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]] over all illicit operations in [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]; eliminate rival factions and internal dissent.
### Long-term Goals
Expand the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]'s power and influence far beyond [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]], potentially establishing a criminal empire built on secrets and stolen arcane artifacts.
### Primary Motivation
Power, control, and the expansion of the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]'s domain.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]] (Guildmaster)
* **Other Affiliations:** May have covert dealings with other powerful criminal or arcane organizations from afar, but always for the benefit of the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]].

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Operates from hidden, highly secure locations within the [[Locations/Veil|Veil]] district, likely the innermost sanctums of the [[Locations/Whispering_Door|Whispering Door]].
* **Recent Events:** Has recently ordered a series of aggressive heists targeting [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]] assets, escalating the underworld conflict.
* **Relevant Quests:** The ultimate target for any mission seeking to dismantle or severely cripple the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]; a source of vast secrets and resources if their lair could be infiltrated.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] might be tasked by [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]] to gather intelligence on The Wraith's operations; The Wraith might take a personal interest in [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s unique skills, attempting to recruit or eliminate him; uncovering the Wraith's true identity or past could be a major campaign arc.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
The Wraith should be an ominous, unseen presence for much of the campaign. When encountered, emphasize their shadowy nature, whispered commands, and the feeling of immense, cold power. Their [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Elf_Race_2024#B. Drow|Drow]] heritage should hint at a ruthlessness and a deep understanding of darkness. They are a true antagonist.
