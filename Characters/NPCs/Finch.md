# Finch

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Human
* **Gender:** Female
* **Age:** (approximate) Early teens
* **Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral
* **Occupation:** Leader of the Ratlings
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Supporting
* **Disposition towards PC:** Friendly (like a little sister to Vaelin)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Finch is small and wiry, with quick, darting movements. Her dark, unkempt hair is usually tied back, and her eyes, bright and intelligent, constantly scan her surroundings. She favors practical, patched clothing that allows for easy movement through the narrow alleys of the Shadow Quarter. She carries a battered but well-maintained slingshot.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Street-smart, fiercely loyal to her gang, pragmatic, and surprisingly empathetic despite her tough exterior.
### Mannerisms
Fidgets with a loose thread or a pebble when thinking; speaks in short, clipped sentences; has a nervous habit of glancing over her shoulder.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "We protect our own, because no one else will."
**Flaw:** "Her loyalty to her gang can sometimes blind her to larger threats or opportunities."

## IV. Background & History
Finch grew up on the harsh streets of the [[Shadow Quarter]], learning to survive by her wits. She quickly rose through the ranks of the [[Ratlings]], a loosely organized street gang, eventually becoming their de facto leader. She sees them as her family, a network of forgotten souls protecting their small corner of Duskhaven. She respects Vaelin, viewing him as a more skilled, perhaps more dangerous, older brother who understands the necessity of operating in the shadows.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Secure resources for her gang; ensure the safety of the Ratlings' territory; keep an eye on unusual activities in the Shadow Quarter.
### Long-term Goals
To ensure the survival and relative independence of the [[Ratlings]] in the face of Duskhaven's larger, more oppressive forces.
### Primary Motivation
Protecting her "family" â€“ the Ratlings and the Shadow Quarter.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** [[Ratlings]] (Leader)
* **Other Affiliations:** Maintains a working relationship with [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]]; generally avoids direct conflict with larger criminal organizations like the [[Harbor Syndicate]] and [[Nightshade Guild]], preferring to operate beneath their notice.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Operates throughout the [[Shadow Quarter]], with a hidden base known only to her most trusted.
* **Recent Events:** Has noticed an increase in strange symbols appearing in overlooked corners of the Shadow Quarter, possibly related to the Void cult.
* **Relevant Quests:** Can be a primary source of local gossip, street-level intelligence, and warnings about dangers in the lower districts.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Finch might ask Vaelin to deal with a specific threat to the Ratlings; she could offer a shortcut or a safe route through a dangerous part of the city; she might need assistance with a difficult scavenging or information-gathering task.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Finch's voice should be sharp and quick, reflecting her street-smart nature. She is pragmatic and will always prioritize her gang's well-being. Her chalk marks and network should be utilized as subtle clues for Vaelin.
