# Finch

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Human
* **Gender:** Female
* **Age:** (approximate) 14 years old
* **Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral
* **Occupation:** Leader of the [[Ratlings]]
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Supporting
* **Disposition towards PC:** Friendly (sees [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] as a big brother)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Finch is a short and scrawny 14-year-old [[Human]] girl. Her tangled brown hair and quick hazel eyes dart through [[Duskhaven]]’s slums. Her patched cloak hides nimble fingers and a sharp mind. She carries a battered but well-maintained slingshot.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Clever and fiercely independent, Finch’s [[Human]] resourcefulness makes her a master of survival at a young age. She trusts [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] implicitly, viewing his attic hideout as hers, and her loyalty ensures she’ll never betray him.
### Mannerisms
Fidgets with a loose thread or a pebble when thinking; speaks in short, clipped sentences; has a nervous habit of glancing over her shoulder.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "We protect our own, because no one else will."
**Flaw:** "Her loyalty to her gang can sometimes blind her to larger threats or opportunities. She may hold back details to protect her [[Ratlings]] unless pressed."

## IV. Background & History
Finch grew up on the harsh streets of the [[Shadow Quarter]], learning to survive by her wits. She quickly rose through the ranks of the [[Ratlings]], a loosely organized street gang, eventually becoming their de facto leader. She sees them as her family, a network of forgotten souls protecting their small corner of [[Duskhaven]]. She respects [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]], viewing him as a more skilled, perhaps more dangerous, older brother who understands the necessity of operating in the shadows. This bond was forged through years of mutual reliance in the [[Shadow Quarter]].

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Secure resources for her gang; ensure the safety of the [[Ratlings]]' territory; keep an eye on unusual activities in the [[Shadow Quarter]].
### Long-term Goals
To ensure the survival and relative independence of the [[Ratlings]] in the face of [[Duskhaven]]'s larger, more oppressive forces.
### Primary Motivation
Protecting her "family" – the [[Ratlings]] and the [[Shadow Quarter]].

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** [[Ratlings]] (Leader)
* **Other Affiliations:** Maintains a working relationship with [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]]; generally avoids direct conflict with larger criminal organizations like the [[Harbor Syndicate]] and [[Nightshade Guild]], preferring to operate beneath their notice.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Operates throughout the [[Shadow Quarter]], [[Docks]], and [[Market Square]], with a hidden base known only to her most trusted.
* **Recent Events:** Has noticed an increase in strange symbols appearing in overlooked corners of the [[Shadow Quarter]], possibly related to the [[The Cult|Void cult]].
* **Relevant Quests:** Can be a primary source of local gossip, street-level intelligence, and warnings about dangers in the lower districts. She is a reliable ally, providing intel and security for [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]]’s hideout.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Finch might ask [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] to deal with a specific threat to the [[Ratlings]]; she could offer a shortcut or a safe route through a dangerous part of the city; she might need assistance with a difficult scavenging or information-gathering task. Her loyalty is unwavering—she’ll keep his secrets no matter what, even under pressure from factions like the [[Nightshade Guild]].

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Finch's voice should be sharp and quick, reflecting her street-smart nature. She is pragmatic and will always prioritize her gang's well-being. Her chalk marks and network should be utilized as subtle clues for [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]]. Her deep loyalty to [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] is a key factor.
