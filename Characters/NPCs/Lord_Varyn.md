* **Gender:** Male
* **Age:** (approximate) 50s
* **Alignment:** Lawful Evil
* **Occupation:** Corrupt Noble
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Supporting
* **Disposition towards PC:** Wary (as he is untrustworthy)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Lord Varyn is a portly human noble in his 50s. His florid cheeks and glittering rings betray his wealth. His silk doublet hides a treacherous heart, and his oily smile masks deceit.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Greedy and duplicitous, Varyn is outwardly charming but ruthless. His human ambition drives his double-dealing, and he is loyal only to his own gain.
### Mannerisms
His smile is often described as "oily". He likely uses wealth to manipulate.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Wealth is the ultimate power, and it justifies any means to acquire it."
**Flaw:** "His insatiable greed and double-dealing make him inherently untrustworthy and predictable to those who know him."

## IV. Background & History
Lord Varyn is a prominent figure in [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]'s [[Locations/Noble_District|Noble District]], seemingly a pillar of high society, but secretly a corrupt noble aligned with [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]]. However, his loyalty to [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]] is questionable, as he is known to be untrustworthy, driven solely by his own ambition and desire for personal gain. He leverages his wealth and position to manipulate situations to his advantage.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Increase his personal wealth and influence; secure new advantageous deals, regardless of their legality or morality.
### Long-term Goals
Solidify his family's power and position within [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]'s elite, potentially through further corruption or hidden alliances.
### Primary Motivation
Greed and self-aggrandizement.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]] (aligned with, but untrustworthy)
* **Other Affiliations:** Has numerous connections among other corrupt nobles, merchants, and possibly even criminal elements whom he manipulates.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Resides in the [[Locations/Noble_District|Noble District]] of [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]].
* **Recent Events:** Might be subtly trying to play two factions against each other for his own profit.
* **Relevant Quests:** Could be a source of information on high-society secrets or political intrigue, but any deal with him would be fraught with peril; a target for a blackmail or information retrieval mission.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Lord Varyn might offer [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] a seemingly lucrative mission that is actually a trap; [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] could uncover Varyn's double-dealings, creating an opportunity for leverage; Varyn's actions could lead to a scandal that impacts [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]] or other factions.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Portray Lord Varyn as outwardly charming and suave, but with an underlying current of menace and self-interest. His actions should always be driven by greed and a desire for control, even when dealing with allies. He is a master manipulator.
