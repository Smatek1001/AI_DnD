## II. Appearance
### Physical Description

## III. Personality & Demeanor

### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "The safest path is the one that fills your pockets."
**Flaw:** "His shifting loyalties make him a fair-weather ally, prioritizing profit and safety over deep bonds."

## IV. Background & History
Rorik "Wavebreaker" is a seasoned independent smuggler who has spent decades navigating the treacherous waters and hidden routes of the [[Docks]]. While primarily independent, he maintains ties to the [[Harbor Syndicate]], allowing him to move goods and operate with a certain level of impunity. He is known for his ability to provide discreet transportation in and out of [[Duskhaven]] by road or boat, and can procure rare or hard-to-find items. He has an ongoing working relationship with [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]], built on professional deals.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Execute current smuggling contracts successfully; avoid detection; make profitable deals.
### Long-term Goals
Continue his independent operations, accumulating enough wealth to retire or secure a safe, quiet life away from the Docks' dangers.
### Primary Motivation
Profit and survival.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** None (Independent)
* **Other Affiliations:** Has ties to the [[Harbor Syndicate]], and a professional rapport with [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]].

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Operates primarily in the [[Docks]] district, often seen near shipping vessels or quiet warehouses.
* **Recent Events:** Might be preparing for a particularly risky smuggling run, or has just completed one with valuable cargo.
* **Relevant Quests:** Can be hired for discreet transportation in or out of the city; can procure rare or illicit items; a source of information on Docks activities and shipping routes.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Rorik might offer Vaelin a lucrative smuggling job; he could be intercepted by city watch or a rival faction during a run, requiring Vaelin's aid; he might possess a key item Vaelin needs to acquire, but for a steep price.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Rorik should be portrayed as competent but cautious. His loyalty is flexible, so Vaelin should always be aware of the pragmatic nature of their relationship. He is a valuable resource but not a deep ally. His shifting loyalty should be emphasized by his pragmatism.
