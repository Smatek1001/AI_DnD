## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Elara is a lithe young woman with bright, inquisitive eyes that dart around the room, taking everything in. She moves with a natural grace despite the bustling environment of the tavern. Her auburn hair is often braided, and she wears simple, functional server's attire. She has a quick, engaging smile, but her gaze is often far away, dreaming of a life beyond the Docks.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Curious, observant, empathetic, and secretly restless.
### Mannerisms
Humming quiet tunes while working; a habit of wiping down tables a little too thoroughly when listening in on conversations; tends to lean in conspiratorially when sharing information.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "There's a bigger world out there, and I want to see it."
**Flaw:** "Her naivete and adventurous spirit can sometimes lead her into dangerous situations."

## IV. Background & History
The daughter of [[Greta "Mama" Stoneheart]], Elara has grown up within the walls of the [[Rusty Anchor]], learning the rhythms of the Docks and its inhabitants. While she loves her mother, she secretly chafes under the perceived safety of her existence, dreaming of adventures beyond Duskhaven. Her observant nature and quiet manner have made her an unwitting, yet effective, informant.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Earn enough coin to save up for her own escape from Duskhaven; continue gathering intriguing rumors.
### Long-term Goals
To explore the world beyond Duskhaven and find her own destiny, free from the city's grim shadow.
### Primary Motivation
Freedom and a thirst for adventure.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** None
* **Other Affiliations:** Due to her position at the Rusty Anchor, she is an unofficial, neutral source of information for various patrons, including those from the [[Harbor Syndicate]] and [[Nightshade Guild]].

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Primarily at the [[Rusty Anchor]].
* **Recent Events:** Recently overheard a particularly suspicious conversation about a "shipment" that deviated from the usual Syndicate channels, piquing her curiosity.
* **Relevant Quests:** Can be a source of valuable rumors and overheard snippets of information from the Docks underworld; might ask Vaelin for assistance in fulfilling a small, personal ambition.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** She might unknowingly stumble upon a secret that puts her in danger, requiring Vaelin's help; she could be approached by a mysterious stranger seeking information, drawing Vaelin into a new intrigue; her desire for adventure could lead her to seek out Vaelin for an opportunity to leave the city.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Elara's disposition should be one of quiet yearning and curiosity. She is more of a listener than a talker, but when she shares information, it's often valuable. Her connection to Greta should be strong and protective.
