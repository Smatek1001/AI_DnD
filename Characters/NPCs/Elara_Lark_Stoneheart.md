# Elara "Lark" Stoneheart

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Human
* **Gender:** Female
* **Age:** (approximate) Late teens
* **Alignment:** Chaotic Good
* **Occupation:** Tavern Server / Informant
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Minor
* **Disposition towards PC:** Friendly (has a big crush on [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]])

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Elara is a slender [[Human]] woman in her late teens. Her bright green eyes and quick smile mask a sharp mind. Her serverâ€™s apron conceals a knack for eavesdropping. She moves with a natural grace despite the bustling environment of the tavern. Her auburn hair is often braided.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Charming and cunning, Elara uses her [[Human]] adaptability to gather intel. She is loyal to [[Greta "Mama" Stoneheart]] but affectionate toward [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]]. Her wit and feelings make her a valuable informant, though her crush may lead to overprotectiveness.
### Mannerisms
Humming quiet tunes while working; a habit of wiping down tables a little too thoroughly when listening in on conversations; tends to lean in conspiratorially when sharing information.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "There's a bigger world out there, and I want to see it."
**Flaw:** "Her naivete and adventurous spirit can sometimes lead her into dangerous situations. Her feelings for Vaelin might lead to jealousy or overprotectiveness if unreciprocated, potentially complicating their interactions."

## IV. Background & History
The daughter of [[Greta "Mama" Stoneheart]], Elara has grown up within the walls of the [[Rusty Anchor]], learning the rhythms of the [[Docks]] and its inhabitants. She has a big crush on [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]], her affection evident in her bright smiles whenever he visits the [[Rusty Anchor]]. This makes her a reliable informant, sharing rumors freely.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Earn enough coin to save up for her own escape from [[Duskhaven]]; continue gathering intriguing rumors. Aid her mother [[Greta "Mama" Stoneheart]].
### Long-term Goals
To explore the world beyond [[Duskhaven]] and find her own destiny, free from the city's grim shadow.
### Primary Motivation
Freedom and a thirst for adventure, influenced by her feelings for [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]].

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** None
* **Other Affiliations:** Due to her position at the [[Rusty Anchor]], she is an unofficial, neutral source of information for various patrons, including those from the [[Harbor Syndicate]] and [[Nightshade Guild]].

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Primarily at the [[Rusty Anchor]].
* **Recent Events:** Recently overheard a particularly suspicious conversation about a "shipment" that deviated from the usual [[Harbor Syndicate]] channels, piquing her curiosity.
* **Relevant Quests:** Can be a source of valuable rumors and overheard snippets of information from the [[Docks]] underworld; might ask [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] for a small, personal favor.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** She thinks she is able to hide her affection for [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]], but he is the only one that doesn't notice. She might unknowingly stumble upon a secret that puts her in danger, requiring [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]]'s help; she could be approached by a mysterious stranger seeking information, drawing [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] into a new intrigue; her desire for adventure could lead her to seek out [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] for an opportunity to leave the city.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Elara's disposition should be one of quiet yearning and curiosity. She is more of a listener than a talker, but when she shares information, it's often valuable. Her connection to [[Greta "Mama" Stoneheart]] should be strong and protective. Her crush on [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] is a significant personality trait that should subtly influence her interactions and potential plot developments.
