## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Thorne is a lean human man in his 40s. His close-cropped dark hair and cold grey eyes exude menace. His tailored cloak hides a rapier and espionage tools. He moves with a quiet, predatory grace.

## III. Personality & Demeanor

Calculating and sadistic, Thorne relishes manipulation. His human versatility makes him a master spy. He distrusts [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] but sees his potential. He is patient and observes more than he speaks.
### Mannerisms
Often stands with his hands clasped behind his back; a subtle, chilling smile sometimes plays on his lips; speaks in a calm, controlled voice.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Information is the ultimate weapon, and control through deception is the highest form of power."
**Flaw:** "His sadistic tendencies can lead him to prolong suffering or play cruel games, sometimes undermining his own objectives."

## IV. Background & History
Thorne is a high-ranking elder within the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]], specializing in espionage and covert operations. He manages a network of spies, including individuals like [[Characters/NPCs/Rynna|Rynna]] (in her capacity as an informant/agent for him, if she provides intel beyond fencing) from the [[Locations/Veil|Veil]] district. His reputation for ruthlessness and his mastery of intelligence gathering make him a formidable force within the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]].

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Gather crucial intelligence on rival factions, city authorities, or valuable targets; eliminate any threats to the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]'s espionage network.

Expand the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]'s intelligence gathering capabilities and ensure its continued dominance through superior information.
### Primary Motivation
Power through knowledge and manipulation.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Operates from hidden offices or meeting points within the [[Locations/Veil|Veil]] district, often near the [[Locations/Whispering_Door|Whispering Door]].
* **Recent Events:** Might be planning a significant intelligence operation against the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]] or a high-profile target within the [[Locations/Noble_District|Noble District]].
* **Relevant Quests:** Can be a source of dangerous espionage missions for [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]], where [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] might be tasked to gather intel or infiltrate a rival organization; potentially holds information that could be leveraged.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Thorne might subtly try to recruit or test [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]], seeing his potential for espionage; [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] could stumble upon one of Thorne's covert operations, putting him at risk; Thorne might order a difficult intelligence extraction that challenges [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s skills.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Thorne should be cold, calculating, and slightly unsettling. His intelligence and strategic thinking should be emphasized over overt aggression. His interactions with [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] should feel like a chess match, with Thorne always probing and assessing.
