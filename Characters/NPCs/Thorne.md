# Thorne

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Human
* **Gender:** Male
* **Age:** (approximate) 40s
* **Alignment:** Lawful Evil
* **Occupation:** Nightshade Guild Elder (overseeing espionage)
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Supporting
* **Disposition towards PC:** Wary (distrusts [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] but sees his potential)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Thorne is a lean [[Human]] man in his 40s. His close-cropped dark hair and cold grey eyes exude menace. His tailored cloak hides a rapier and espionage tools. He moves with a quiet, predatory grace.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Calculating and sadistic, Thorne relishes manipulation. His [[Human]] versatility makes him a master spy. He distrusts [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] but sees his potential. He is patient and observes more than he speaks.
### Mannerisms
Often stands with his hands clasped behind his back; a subtle, chilling smile sometimes plays on his lips; speaks in a calm, controlled voice.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Information is the ultimate weapon, and control through deception is the highest form of power."
**Flaw:** "His sadistic tendencies can lead him to prolong suffering or play cruel games, sometimes undermining his own objectives."

## IV. Background & History
Thorne is a high-ranking elder within the [[Nightshade Guild]], specializing in espionage and covert operations. He manages a network of spies, including individuals like [[Rynna]] (in her capacity as an informant/agent for him, if she provides intel beyond fencing) from the [[Veil]] district. His reputation for ruthlessness and his mastery of intelligence gathering make him a formidable force within the [[Nightshade Guild]].

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Gather crucial intelligence on rival factions, city authorities, or valuable targets; eliminate any threats to the [[Nightshade Guild]]'s espionage network.
### Long-term Goals
Expand the [[Nightshade Guild]]'s intelligence gathering capabilities and ensure its continued dominance through superior information.
### Primary Motivation
Power through knowledge and manipulation.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** [[Nightshade Guild]] (Elder, Head of Espionage)
* **Other Affiliations:** Commands a network of spies and informants.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Operates from hidden offices or meeting points within the [[Veil]] district, often near the [[Whispering Door]].
* **Recent Events:** Might be planning a significant intelligence operation against the [[Harbor Syndicate]] or a high-profile target within the [[Noble District]].
* **Relevant Quests:** Can be a source of dangerous espionage missions for [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]], where [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] might be tasked to gather intel or infiltrate a rival organization; potentially holds information that could be leveraged.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Thorne might subtly try to recruit or test [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]], seeing his potential for espionage; [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] could stumble upon one of Thorne's covert operations, putting him at risk; Thorne might order a difficult intelligence extraction that challenges [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]]'s skills.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Thorne should be cold, calculating, and slightly unsettling. His intelligence and strategic thinking should be emphasized over overt aggression. His interactions with [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] should feel like a chess match, with Thorne always probing and assessing.
