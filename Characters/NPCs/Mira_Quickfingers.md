## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Mira is a nimble halfling woman in her late 20s. Her quick fingers and sharp hazel eyes constantly dart through the bustling crowds of the [[Locations/Market_Square|Market Square]]. Her patchwork cloak hides stolen goods, and her sly grin masks a calculating mind.

### Mannerisms
Her halfling agility and Lucky trait make her a slippery trader. She has a sly grin.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Profit and survival above all else."
**Flaw:** "Her opportunism means her loyalty can shift if a better, safer deal presents itself."

## IV. Background & History
Mira has carved out a niche for herself in the bustling [[Locations/Market_Square|Market Square]] of [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]] as a highly effective fence. While operating independently, she maintains ties to the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]], allowing her to move a wider variety of illicit goods. She has established a good working relationship with [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]], based on mutual profit.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Acquire new, profitable stolen goods; maintain her network of buyers and sellers; avoid drawing undue attention from city authorities or major factions.
### Long-term Goals
Increase her personal wealth and secure her position in [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]'s black market, perhaps even establishing a more formal fencing operation.
### Primary Motivation
Profit and self-preservation.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]] (Informal ties/Independent)
* **Other Affiliations:** Operates largely independently, but leverages contacts within the Guild for protection and larger deals.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks

* **Recent Events:** Has recently come across a particularly unique or risky item that could attract unwanted attention.
* **Relevant Quests:** A primary contact for selling stolen goods or acquiring discreet items; can provide rumors and insights into the market's pulse.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Mira might have a lead on a rare item [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] is seeking; she could be in trouble with a rival fence or a Guild boss, requiring [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s aid; she might offer a lucrative but dangerous opportunity to acquire an item.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Mira's halfling agility should be evident in her movements and her ability to slip through crowds. Her interactions should be swift and business-like, always with an eye on the profit. Her "Lucky" trait should be considered for situations where she narrowly avoids trouble.
