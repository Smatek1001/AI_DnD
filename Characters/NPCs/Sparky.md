# Sparky
A nervous young man and skilled tinker who was part of the Rust Dogs gang out of fear. He showed a conscience and a love for creating/fixing things (e.g., a clockwork bird). He was the first to flee when Vaelin's "haunting" began and has likely disappeared into the warrens of the Shadow Quarter.
