# Garrick Stonehand

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Dwarf
* **Gender:** Male
* **Age:** (approximate) 40s
* **Alignment:** Neutral
* **Occupation:** Merchant
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Minor
* **Disposition towards PC:** Wary

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Garrick is a stout Dwarf in his 40s. His grizzled beard and gaunt eyes betray his precarious position. His cluttered [[Locations/Market_Square|Market Square]] shop hides rare goods behind a forced merchantâ€™s smile, and his enduring dwarven frame appears unbowed by debt.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Cautious and shrewd, Garrick is suspicious of strangers. He trades with a smile but frets over debts to the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]] or [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]].
### Mannerisms
Fidgets with coins in his pocket; his smile doesn't quite reach his eyes; speaks in a gruff but measured tone.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "A fair deal is a good deal, but a secret deal is often better."
**Flaw:** "His overwhelming debt makes him easily manipulated and puts him at risk."

## IV. Background & History
Garrick Stonehand runs a cluttered shop in [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]'s [[Locations/Market_Square|Market Square]], dealing in various goods, some rare and some less-than-legitimate. He has accumulated significant debts to either the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]] or the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]] (or perhaps both), which constantly weigh on him and make him extremely cautious of any new faces or unexpected inquiries.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Make enough profit to cover his next debt payment; acquire new inventory to keep his shop afloat.
### Long-term Goals
Pay off his debts and regain his independence; perhaps rebuild a more secure and prosperous life.
### Primary Motivation
Survival and freedom from debt.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** None (Independent)
* **Other Affiliations:** Indebted to the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]] and/or [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]].

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** His shop in the [[Locations/Market_Square|Market Square]].
* **Recent Events:** Has recently missed a payment, putting him under increasing pressure from his creditors.
* **Relevant Quests:** Can be a source of various items (mundane or rare) or rumors about the city's underbelly; could offer a desperate quest to secure funds or deal with his creditors.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Garrick might approach [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] for help with his debt, leading [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] into conflict with a [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]] or [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]] enforcer; he could be forced to provide information or goods to one of the factions, which [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] could intercept or exploit; [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] might need to extract a specific item from Garrick's shop under duress.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Garrick should be portrayed as perpetually anxious, even when trying to appear cordial. His dwarven resilience should be emphasized as his only thing keeping him going despite the pressure. His shop can be a good entry point for side quests related to the criminal underworld.
