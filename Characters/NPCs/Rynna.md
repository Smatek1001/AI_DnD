# Rynna

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Goblin
* **Gender:** Female
* **Age:** (approximate) 30s
* **Alignment:** Neutral Evil
* **Occupation:** Fence / Guild Operative
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Supporting
* **Disposition towards PC:** Wary (initially, becomes pragmatic if useful)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Rynna has a sharp, intelligent green face, often framed by dark, slicked-back hair. Her small, beady eyes miss nothing, and she moves with a swift, almost predatory grace. She favors simple, high-quality clothing that doesn't draw attention but speaks of her hidden means. Her hands are slender, with long, unadorned fingers, and her smile is a thin, calculating line of sharp teeth.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Shrewd, calculating, distrustful, and highly professional in her dealings. She values efficiency and discretion above all else.
### Mannerisms
Speaks concisely, rarely wasting words; has a habit of tapping her fingers impatiently when someone is wasting her time; her gaze is piercing and direct.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "The value of an item is only what someone is willing to pay for it, and I'll find that price."
**Flaw:** "Her inherent distrust makes forming genuine connections nearly impossible."

## IV. Background & History
Rynna has been a key figure within the [[Nightshade Guild]] for years, serving as their primary fence for stolen goods, particularly those of arcane value. Her goblin cunning and sharp eye for a deal have made her invaluable. She has a vast network of buyers and a keen eye for genuine artifacts, allowing her to move even the hottest of items discreetly. Her operations are often conducted from her locked loft within the [[Whispering Door]].

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Acquire and sell high-value stolen goods; maintain the Guild's network of buyers; avoid detection by city authorities or rival factions.
### Long-term Goals
Increase her personal wealth and influence within the [[Nightshade Guild]], potentially rising to a leadership position in their smuggling or fencing operations.
### Primary Motivation
Profit and the security that comes with it.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** [[Nightshade Guild]] (Key fence and operative)
* **Other Affiliations:** Has a wide array of contacts among collectors, black marketeers, and disreputable merchants.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Primarily at the [[Whispering Door]], specifically her locked loft.
* **Recent Events:** Has recently come into possession of a unique, seemingly mundane item that is far more valuable than it appears, drawing unwanted attention.
* **Relevant Quests:** A primary contact for selling stolen goods or acquiring rare items; can offer specific information on Guild targets or rival operations for the right price.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Rynna might require Vaelin's help in acquiring a difficult item or securing a sensitive transaction; she might become a target for a rival faction seeking to disrupt the Guild's finances; she could offer Vaelin a quest related to a particularly valuable magical artifact.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Rynna should be portrayed as business-like and transactional. She's not easily impressed or swayed by emotional appeals. Her interactions with Vaelin should be purely professional unless he proves exceptionally valuable. She will use coded language in public. Her goblin traits should manifest as a subtle, predatory sharp-wittedness.
