# Rynna

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Goblin
* **Gender:** Female
* **Age:** (approximate) 30s
* **Alignment:** Neutral Evil
* **Occupation:** Nightshade Guild Fence
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Supporting
* **Disposition towards PC:** Wary (initially, becomes pragmatic if useful)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Rynna is a wiry [[Goblin]] woman in her 30s. Her sharp teeth and glinting yellow eyes betray her cunning. Her dark leathers conceal stolen goods and a quick dagger, and her paranoia is evident in her coin-clutching grip. She moves with a swift, almost predatory grace.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Shrewd and ruthless, Rynna thrives on betrayal. Her [[Goblin]] guile makes her a slippery contact. Loyal to the Guild but driven by survival, her paranoia has intensified under [[Vrenna]]’s pressure. She is calculating and highly professional in her dealings.
### Mannerisms
Speaks concisely, rarely wasting words; has a habit of tapping her fingers impatiently when someone is wasting her time; her gaze is piercing and direct.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "The value of an item is only what someone is willing to pay for it, and I'll find that price."
**Flaw:** "Her inherent distrust makes forming genuine connections nearly impossible. Her paranoia can make her unpredictable."

## IV. Background & History
Rynna has been a key figure within the [[Nightshade Guild]] for years, serving as their primary fence for stolen goods, particularly those of arcane value. She trades relics and secrets in the [[Veil]]’s [[Whispering Door]]. Her [[Goblin]] cunning and sharp eye for a deal have made her invaluable. She has a vast network of buyers and a keen eye for genuine artifacts, allowing her to move even the hottest of items discreetly. Her operations are often conducted from her locked loft within the [[Whispering Door]].

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Acquire and sell high-value stolen goods; maintain the [[Nightshade Guild]]'s network of buyers; avoid drawing unwanted attention from city authorities or rival factions.
### Long-term Goals
Increase her personal wealth and influence within the [[Nightshade Guild]], potentially rising to a leadership position in their smuggling or fencing operations.
### Primary Motivation
Profit and the security that comes with it.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** [[Nightshade Guild]] (Key fence and operative)
* **Other Affiliations:** Has a wide array of contacts among collectors, black marketeers, and disreputable merchants.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Primarily at the [[Whispering Door]], specifically her locked loft.
* **Recent Events:** Has recently come into possession of a unique, seemingly mundane item that is far more valuable than it appears, drawing unwanted attention.
* **Relevant Quests:** A primary contact for selling stolen goods or acquiring rare items; can offer specific information on [[Nightshade Guild]] targets or rival operations for the right price.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Rynna might require [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s help in acquiring a difficult item or securing a sensitive transaction; she might become a target for a rival faction seeking to disrupt the [[Nightshade Guild]]'s finances; she could offer [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]] a quest related to a particularly valuable magical artifact.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Rynna should be portrayed as business-like and transactional. She's not easily impressed or swayed by emotional appeals. Her interactions with [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]] should be purely professional unless he proves exceptionally valuable. She will use coded language in public. Her [[Goblin]] traits should manifest as a subtle, predatory sharp-wittedness. Her increased paranoia under [[Vrenna]]'s pressure should be evident.
