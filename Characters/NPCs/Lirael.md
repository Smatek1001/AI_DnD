# Lirael

## I. Overview
* **Race:** [[Bestiary/Flickerling|Flickerling]]
* **Gender:** Female
* **Age:** (apparent) Young
* **Alignment:** Chaotic Good (inferred from "mischievous and playful")
* **Occupation:** Familiar (gained through Pact of the Chain)
* Status: active (manifested on Campaign Day 4 at Sylvandell's Mirror; bound to Vaelin Shadowleaf via his Warlock pact with Caladwen and the Pact of the Chain invocation)
* **Importance:** Pivotal (as [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s familiar)
* **Disposition towards PC:** Friendly

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Lirael is a delicate, winged creature resembling a miniature young woman with shimmering dragonfly wings and luminous skin in her default form. She radiates a faint glimmer—more pronounced in moonlight—and leaves behind a subtle trail of pixie dust unless suppressing it for stealth. Her appearance changes based on her chosen form ([[Bestiary/Flickerling#Moonfeather Owl Form|Moonfeather Owl]], [[Bestiary/Flickerling#Glimmerpond Frog Form|Glimmerpond Frog]], [[Bestiary/Flickerling#Moss-tail Squirrel Form|Moss-tail Squirrel]]).

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Mischievous and playful, yet sharp and capable in dangerous situations. She is a lover of secrets and gossip. Highly adaptive, using her animal forms to suit the mission.
### Mannerisms
Often whispers enemy nicknames like “Snotgob,” “Bignose,” or “Buttstink” in [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s ear. Prone to perching on [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s shoulder, whispering spontaneous suggestions. Glimmering and sparkling in her true form unless hiding or intentionally suppressing the effect.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Uncovering secrets is the greatest game, and protecting my master is the highest joy."
**Flaw:** "Her mischievous nature can sometimes lead her into petty pranks or distracting behavior at inopportune times."

## IV. Background & History
Lirael, a unique [[Bestiary/Flickerling|Flickerling]], was dispatched by the Archfey [[Lore/Pantheon/Caladwen|Caladwen]] and manifested before [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] at Sylvandell's Mirror on Campaign Day 4. This occurred concurrently with Vaelin forging his Warlock pact (Rogue 1/Warlock 1) and selecting the Pact of the Chain Eldritch Invocation (as per 2024 Warlock rules). Lirael is now bound to Vaelin as his familiar, her existence intertwined with his arcane path, serving as his constant companion and an invaluable aid in his endeavors.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
(Will develop once summoned)
### Long-term Goals
To explore the world alongside [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]; to witness and participate in the grand unfolding of secrets and mysteries.
### Primary Motivation
Loyalty to [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]], and an insatiable curiosity and love for mischief.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** None (will be bound to [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]])
* **Other Affiliations:** Inherently tied to the Feywild, but will largely operate independently with [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]].

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** With [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] (initially manifested at Sylvandell's Mirror, Campaign Day 4).
* **Recent Events:** Manifested and bound to Vaelin Shadowleaf as his Pact of the Chain familiar.
* **Relevant Quests:** (Will become relevant once summoned)
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** (Will become relevant once summoned). Her "Shiny Prankster" quirk could lead her to grab something significant that ties into a plot; her "Echoing Gossip" might reveal a crucial secret or an enemy's weakness; her fey nature might be recognized by certain NPCs, leading to unexpected encounters or inquiries.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Once summoned, she will be a highly versatile familiar for [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]], excelling in scouting, stealth, and intelligence gathering, complementing his rogue/spy abilities. Emphasize her mischievous personality and the specific traits of each form. Her subtle fey signs should be for flavor.
