# Lirael

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Flickerling
* **Gender:** Female
* **Age:** (apparent) Young
* **Alignment:** Chaotic Good (inferred from "mischievous and playful")
* **Occupation:** Familiar (gained through Pact of the Chain)
* **Status:** pending (not yet active in-game)
* **Importance:** Pivotal (as Vaelin's familiar)
* **Disposition towards PC:** Friendly

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Lirael is a delicate, winged creature resembling a miniature young woman with shimmering dragonfly wings and luminous skin in her default form. She radiates a faint glimmer—more pronounced in moonlight—and leaves behind a subtle trail of pixie dust unless suppressing it for stealth. Her appearance changes based on her chosen form (Moonfeather Owl, Glimmerpond Frog, Moss-tail Squirrel).

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Mischievous and playful, yet sharp and capable in dangerous situations. She is a lover of secrets and gossip. Highly adaptive, using her animal forms to suit the mission.
### Mannerisms
Often whispers enemy nicknames like “Snotgob,” “Bignose,” or “Buttstink” in Vaelin's ear. Prone to perching on Vaelin's shoulder, whispering spontaneous suggestions. Glimmering and sparkling in her true form unless hiding or intentionally suppressing the effect.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Uncovering secrets is the greatest game, and protecting my master is the highest joy."
**Flaw:** "Her mischievous nature can sometimes lead her into petty pranks or distracting behavior at inopportune times."

## IV. Background & History
Lirael is a unique Flickerling, destined to be bound to [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]] as his familiar through the Pact of the Chain invocation when he multi-classes into Warlock. Her existence will be tied to Vaelin's burgeoning arcane path, and she will serve as his constant companion and invaluable aid in his espionage endeavors once summoned.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
(Will develop once summoned)
### Long-term Goals
To explore the world alongside Vaelin; to witness and participate in the grand unfolding of secrets and mysteries.
### Primary Motivation
Loyalty to [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]], and an insatiable curiosity and love for mischief.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** None (will be bound to [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]])
* **Other Affiliations:** Inherently tied to the Feywild, but will largely operate independently with Vaelin.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Unmanifested (exists conceptually, but not physically in-game).
* **Recent Events:** N/A
* **Relevant Quests:** (Will become relevant once summoned)
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** (Will become relevant once summoned). Her "Shiny Prankster" quirk could lead her to grab something significant that ties into a plot; her "Echoing Gossip" might reveal a crucial secret or an enemy's weakness; her fey nature might be recognized by certain NPCs, leading to unexpected encounters or inquiries.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Lirael is currently unmanifested. She will only become an active NPC in the game once Vaelin gains the Pact of the Chain familiar feature from his Warlock multi-classing. Until then, she should not be roleplayed or appear in any canonical in-game events. Once summoned, she will be a highly versatile familiar for Vaelin, excelling in scouting, stealth, and intelligence gathering, complementing his rogue/spy abilities. Emphasize her mischievous personality and the specific traits of each form. Her subtle fey signs should be for flavor.
