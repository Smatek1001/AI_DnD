# Lirael

## I. Overview
* **Race:** [[Bestiary/Flickerling|Flickerling]]
* **Gender:** Female
* **Age:** (apparent) Young
* **Alignment:** Chaotic Good (inferred from "mischievous and playful")
* **Occupation:** Familiar (gained through Pact of the Chain)
* **Status:** pending (not yet active in-game)
* **Importance:** Pivotal (as [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s familiar)
* **Disposition towards PC:** Friendly

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Lirael is a delicate, winged creature resembling a miniature young woman with shimmering dragonfly wings and luminous skin in her default form. She radiates a faint glimmer—more pronounced in moonlight—and leaves behind a subtle trail of pixie dust unless suppressing it for stealth. Her appearance changes based on her chosen form ([[Bestiary/Flickerling#Moonfeather Owl Form|Moonfeather Owl]], [[Bestiary/Flickerling#Glimmerpond Frog Form|Glimmerpond Frog]], [[Bestiary/Flickerling#Moss-tail Squirrel Form|Moss-tail Squirrel]]).

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Mischievous and playful, yet sharp and capable in dangerous situations. She is a lover of secrets and gossip. Highly adaptive, using her animal forms to suit the mission.
### Mannerisms
Often whispers enemy nicknames like “Snotgob,” “Bignose,” or “Buttstink” in [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s ear. Prone to perching on [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s shoulder, whispering spontaneous suggestions. Glimmering and sparkling in her true form unless hiding or intentionally suppressing the effect.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Uncovering secrets is the greatest game, and protecting my master is the highest joy."
**Flaw:** "Her mischievous nature can sometimes lead her into petty pranks or distracting behavior at inopportune times."

## IV. Background & History
Lirael is a unique [[Bestiary/Flickerling|Flickerling]], destined to be bound to [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] as his familiar through the Pact of the Chain invocation when he multi-classes into Warlock. Her existence will be tied to [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s burgeoning arcane path, and she will serve as his constant companion and invaluable aid in his espionage endeavors once summoned.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
(Will develop once summoned)
### Long-term Goals
To explore the world alongside [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]; to witness and participate in the grand unfolding of secrets and mysteries.
### Primary Motivation
Loyalty to [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]], and an insatiable curiosity and love for mischief.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** None (will be bound to [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]])
* **Other Affiliations:** Inherently tied to the Feywild, but will largely operate independently with [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]].

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Unmanifested (exists conceptually, but not physically in-game).
* **Recent Events:** N/A
* **Relevant Quests:** (Will become relevant once summoned)
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** (Will become relevant once summoned). Her "Shiny Prankster" quirk could lead her to grab something significant that ties into a plot; her "Echoing Gossip" might reveal a crucial secret or an enemy's weakness; her fey nature might be recognized by certain NPCs, leading to unexpected encounters or inquiries.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Lirael is currently unmanifested. She will only become an active NPC in the game once [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] gains the Pact of the Chain familiar feature from his Warlock multi-classing. Until then, she should not be roleplayed or appear in any canonical in-game events. Once summoned, she will be a highly versatile familiar for [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]], excelling in scouting, stealth, and intelligence gathering, complementing his rogue/spy abilities. Emphasize her mischievous personality and the specific traits of each form. Her subtle fey signs should be for flavor.
