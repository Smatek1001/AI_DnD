* **Age:** (approximate) 50s
* **Alignment:** Lawful Neutral
* **Occupation:** Tavern Proprietor (of the [[Locations/Rusty_Anchor|Rusty Anchor]])
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Supporting
* **Disposition towards PC:** Friendly (maternal figure to [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]])

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Greta is a broad-shouldered human woman in her 50s. Her weathered face and iron-grey hair frame a no-nonsense gaze. Her apron hides a dagger, and her tavern commands respect. Her hands are strong and calloused from years of work. Her presence commands respect without needing to raise her voice.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Stern but fair, Greta enforces neutrality with a motherly iron fist. Her human tenacity keeps the peace. She’s loyal to her daughter [[Characters/NPCs/Elara_Lark_Stoneheart|Elara "Lark" Stoneheart]] and profit, not factions, but prioritizes [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]’s safety, offering him a safe haven.
### Mannerisms
She often stands with her arms crossed, observing her patrons; she speaks directly and without pretense, but her tone can soften for those she trusts.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Order and stability are the only ways to survive in a city like this."
**Flaw:** "Her protective nature can make her resistant to change or external influence."

## IV. Background & History
Greta inherited the [[Locations/Rusty_Anchor|Rusty Anchor]] from her family, who had run it for generations. Over the years, she has earned the respect (and fear) of the various factions operating on the [[Locations/Docks|Docks]], establishing the [[Locations/Rusty_Anchor|Rusty Anchor]] as a true neutral ground. She has been a mother figure to [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] since his earliest days in [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]], offering him shelter and guidance when he was a lost orphan.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Maintain the peace within the [[Locations/Rusty_Anchor|Rusty Anchor]]; ensure the smooth operation of her business.
### Long-term Goals
To see her daughter, [[Characters/NPCs/Elara_Lark_Stoneheart|Elara "Lark" Stoneheart"]], safe and secure, perhaps even out of [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]].
### Primary Motivation
Protecting her family (especially [[Characters/NPCs/Elara_Lark_Stoneheart|Elara "Lark" Stoneheart"]]) and her livelihood.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** None (fiercely neutral)
* **Other Affiliations:** Respected by both the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]] and the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]] due to her unwavering neutrality and the utility of her establishment.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Always at the [[Locations/Rusty_Anchor|Rusty Anchor]].
* **Recent Events:** Has recently had to defuse several tense standoffs between [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]] and [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]] members, indicating rising tensions.
* **Relevant Quests:** Can be a source of reliable information on the [[Locations/Docks|Docks]]' underworld politics; might ask [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] for a favor that benefits her or her family directly.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Her concern ensures [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] has a safe haven at the [[Locations/Rusty_Anchor|Rusty Anchor]], and she’ll warn him of threats if she hears of them. She often urges him to abandon his dangerous rogue life. Her daughter [[Characters/NPCs/Elara_Lark_Stoneheart|Elara "Lark" Stoneheart"]] might get into trouble, requiring [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s intervention; a powerful faction might try to force her to choose sides, threatening the [[Locations/Rusty_Anchor|Rusty Anchor]]'s neutrality.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Greta's voice should be gravelly but kind to [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]], sharp and commanding to others. She rarely shows fear. When she speaks, even the toughest thugs listen. Her warmth is reserved for a select few. Her strong protective nature towards [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] and [[Characters/NPCs/Elara_Lark_Stoneheart|Elara "Lark" Stoneheart"]] is a key element of her character.
