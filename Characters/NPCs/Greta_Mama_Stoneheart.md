# Greta "Mama" Stoneheart

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Human
* **Gender:** Female
* **Age:** (approximate) 50s
* **Alignment:** Lawful Neutral
* **Occupation:** Tavern Proprietor (of the [[Rusty Anchor]])
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Supporting
* **Disposition towards PC:** Friendly (maternal figure to [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]])

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Greta is a broad-shouldered human woman in her 50s. Her weathered face and iron-grey hair frame a no-nonsense gaze. Her apron hides a dagger, and her tavern commands respect. Her hands are strong and calloused from years of work. Her presence commands respect without needing to raise her voice.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Stern but fair, Greta enforces neutrality with a motherly iron fist. Her human tenacity keeps the peace. She’s loyal to her daughter [[Elara "Lark" Stoneheart]] and profit, not factions, but prioritizes [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]]’s safety, offering him a safe haven.
### Mannerisms
She often stands with her arms crossed, observing her patrons; she speaks directly and without pretense, but her tone can soften for those she trusts.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Order and stability are the only ways to survive in a city like this."
**Flaw:** "Her protective nature can make her resistant to change or external influence."

## IV. Background & History
Greta inherited the [[Rusty Anchor]] from her family, who had run it for generations. Over the years, she has earned the respect (and fear) of the various factions operating on the [[Docks]], establishing the Anchor as a true neutral ground. She has been a mother figure to [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]] since his earliest days in [[Duskhaven]], offering him shelter and guidance when he was a lost orphan.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Maintain the peace within the [[Rusty Anchor]]; ensure the smooth operation of her business.
### Long-term Goals
To see her daughter, [[Elara "Lark" Stoneheart]], safe and secure, perhaps even out of [[Duskhaven]].
### Primary Motivation
Protecting her family (especially Elara) and her livelihood.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** None (fiercely neutral)
* **Other Affiliations:** Respected by both the [[Harbor Syndicate]] and the [[Nightshade Guild]] due to her unwavering neutrality and the utility of her establishment.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Always at the [[Rusty Anchor]].
* **Recent Events:** Has recently had to defuse several tense standoffs between Syndicate and Guild members, indicating rising tensions.
* **Relevant Quests:** Can be a source of reliable information on the [[Docks]]' underworld politics; might ask [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]] for a favor that benefits her or her family directly.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Her concern ensures [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]] has a safe haven at the [[Rusty Anchor]], and she’ll warn him of threats if she hears of them. She often urges him to abandon his dangerous rogue life. Her daughter Elara might get into trouble, requiring Vaelin's intervention; a powerful faction might try to force her to choose sides, threatening the Anchor's neutrality.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Greta's voice should be gravelly but kind to Vaelin, sharp and commanding to others. She rarely shows fear. When she speaks, even the toughest thugs listen. Her warmth is reserved for a select few. Her strong protective nature towards Vaelin and Elara is a key element of her character.
