# Greta "Mama" Stoneheart

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Human
* **Gender:** Female
** **Age:** (approximate) 50s
* **Alignment:** Lawful Neutral
* **Occupation:** Tavern Proprietor (of the Rusty Anchor)
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Supporting
* **Disposition towards PC:** Friendly (maternal figure to Vaelin)

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Greta is a stout woman with a no-nonsense demeanor, yet her eyes hold a deep, knowing warmth. Her graying hair is usually pulled back in a severe bun, and her hands are strong and calloused from years of work. She often wears a simple, sturdy apron over practical dresses. Her presence commands respect without needing to raise her voice.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Authoritative, pragmatic, protective of her establishment and those she cares for, and possessing a shrewd understanding of Duskhaven's underworld.
### Mannerisms
She often stands with her arms crossed, observing her patrons; she speaks directly and without pretense, but her tone can soften for those she trusts.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "Order and stability are the only ways to survive in a city like this."
**Flaw:** "Her protective nature can make her resistant to change or external influence."

## IV. Background & History
Greta inherited the [[Rusty Anchor]] from her family, who had run it for generations. Over the years, she has earned the respect (and fear) of the various factions operating on the Docks, establishing the Anchor as a true neutral ground. She took a maternal interest in Vaelin when he was younger, offering him a measure of safety and stability he hadn't known since Therandril's fall.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Maintain the peace within the Rusty Anchor; ensure the smooth operation of her business.
### Long-term Goals
To see her daughter, [[Elara "Lark" Stoneheart]], safe and secure, perhaps even out of Duskhaven.
### Primary Motivation
Protecting her family (especially Elara) and her livelihood.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** None (fiercely neutral)
* **Other Affiliations:** Respected by both the [[Harbor Syndicate]] and the [[Nightshade Guild]] due to her unwavering neutrality and the utility of her establishment.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** Always at the [[Rusty Anchor]].
* **Recent Events:** Has recently had to defuse several tense standoffs between Syndicate and Guild members, indicating rising tensions.
* **Relevant Quests:** Can be a source of reliable information on the Docks' underworld politics; might ask Vaelin for a favor that benefits her or her family directly.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Her daughter Elara might get into trouble, requiring Vaelin's intervention; a powerful faction might try to force her to choose sides, threatening the Anchor's neutrality; she might subtly test Vaelin's loyalty or capabilities.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Greta's voice should be gravelly but kind to Vaelin, sharp and commanding to others. She rarely shows fear. When she speaks, even the toughest thugs listen. Her warmth is reserved for a select few.
