# Farmer Gildas

## I. Overview
* **Race:** Human
* **Gender:** Male
* **Age:** (approximate) 60s
* **Alignment:** Neutral Good
* **Occupation:** Farmer
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Minor
* **Disposition towards PC:** Friendly

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Farmer Gildas is a sturdy, weathered human man with calloused hands and a face deeply lined by sun and toil. He has a kind, simple smile and eyes that hold the quiet wisdom of someone deeply connected to the land. He typically wears practical, roughspun clothes, often smelling faintly of earth and straw.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Hardworking, honest, hospitable, and a man of simple pleasures.
### Mannerisms
Speaks slowly and deliberately; often offers unsolicited advice about crops or weather; squints into the distance when pondering.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "A good harvest and an honest day's work are all a man needs."
**Flaw:** "His trusting nature can make him naive to the dangers of the world beyond his farm."

## IV. Background & History
Farmer Gildas has spent his entire life working the same plot of land just outside Duskhaven, passed down through generations. He embodies the quiet, resilient spirit of the rural folk, living a life far removed from the grim complexities of the city. His days are governed by the sun, the soil, and the seasons.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Ensure a good harvest; maintain his farm and livestock; live peacefully.
### Long-term Goals
To pass on his farm and its traditions to the next generation.
### Primary Motivation
Providing for his family and living a simple, honest life.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** None
* **Other Affiliations:** Member of the local farming community.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** His farm in the lands [[Beyond Duskhaven]].
* **Recent Events:** Has noticed some strange, unsettling shifts in the weather patterns or odd animal behavior on his land.
* **Relevant Quests:** Can provide a brief, grounding interaction for Vaelin; might offer simple tasks.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** (Dream-Only) Gildas might appear in a dream to offer cryptic advice or a symbolic warning related to nature or corruption; he could be a symbol of the simple life Vaelin secretly yearns for, or a victim of an external threat that touches even the quiet countryside.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
**CRITICAL DIRECTIVE:** Farmer Gildas is a **Dream-Only** NPC. Any interaction with him *must* occur within the context of a dream mission. His appearance and dialogue should be symbolic or provide cryptic clues related to Vaelin's deeper subconscious thoughts or unresolved issues, especially those concerning nature, life, and the Void's corruption. Do not allow him to exist or interact in canonical reality. His presence should feel slightly off, like a dream character.
