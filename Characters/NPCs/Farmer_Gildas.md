## I. Overview

* **Alignment:** Neutral Good
* **Occupation:** Farmer
* **Status:** alive
* **Importance:** Minor
* **Disposition towards PC:** Friendly

## II. Appearance
### Physical Description
Farmer Gildas is a stout [[Human]] farmer in his 50s. His weathered face and calloused hands reflect a life of labor. His simple tunic and straw hat mark him as a rural outsider. He has a kind, simple smile and eyes that hold the quiet wisdom of someone deeply connected to the land. He often smells faintly of earth and straw.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Honest and hardworking, Gildas's [[Human]] resilience keeps him grounded. He is protective of his farm and generally hospitable.
### Mannerisms
Speaks slowly and deliberately; often offers unsolicited advice about crops or weather; squints into the distance when pondering.
### Ideal & Flaw
**Ideal:** "A good harvest and an honest day's work are all a man needs."
**Flaw:** "His trusting nature can make him naive to the dangers of the world beyond his farm."

## IV. Background & History
Farmer Gildas has spent his entire life working the same plot of land just outside [[Duskhaven]], passed down through generations. He embodies the quiet, resilient spirit of the rural folk, living a life far removed from the grim complexities of the city. His days are governed by the sun, the soil, and the seasons.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
Ensure a good harvest; maintain his farm and livestock; live peacefully.
### Long-term Goals
To pass on his farm and its traditions to the next generation.
### Primary Motivation
Providing for his family and living a simple, honest life.

## VI. Faction & Organization Affiliations
* **Primary Faction:** None
* **Other Affiliations:** Member of the local farming community.

## VII. Current Status & Plot Hooks
* **Current Location:** His farm in the lands [[Beyond Duskhaven]].
* **Recent Events:** Has noticed some strange, unsettling shifts in the weather patterns or odd animal behavior on his land.
* **Relevant Quests:** Can provide a brief, grounding interaction for [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]]; might offer simple tasks.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** (Dream-Only) Gildas might appear in a dream to offer cryptic advice or a symbolic warning related to nature or corruption; he could be a symbol of the simple life [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]] secretly yearns for, or a victim of an external threat that touches even the quiet countryside.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
**CRITICAL DIRECTIVE:** Farmer Gildas is a **Dream-Only** NPC. Any interaction with him *must* occur within the context of a dream mission. His appearance and dialogue should be symbolic or provide cryptic clues related to [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s deeper subconscious thoughts or unresolved issues, especially those concerning nature, life, and the [[The Nameless Void]]'s corruption. Do not allow him to exist or interact in canonical reality. His presence should feel slightly off, like a dream character.
**Mechanics:** Medium [[Human]], Commoner stats, Strength +2, Perception +2. Non-combat, relies on farm dog.
