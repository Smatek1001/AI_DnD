* **Ability Score Increase:** Dexterity +2, Intelligence +1 (already applied above)

* **Fey Ancestry:** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
* **Trance:** Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is "trance." While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

## VI. Character Personality & Roleplaying

### Appearance:
A 5’11” [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Elf_Race_2024#C. High Elves|High Elf]] Rogue, Vaelin Shadowleaf moves with the graceful precision of a shadow. Fair skin and platinum blonde hair, tied back in a tight braid before missions, mark his elven heritage, but both are darkened with a disguise kit or a smear of dirt to blend seamlessly as a “grey man.” Hypnotic blue eyes, radiant as polished sapphires yet fathomless as an endless sea, mesmerize with an enchanting depth that betrays the “grey man” facade, drawing fleeting glances before a practiced smile redirects attention. A lean frame slips effortlessly into [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]’s crowds, clad in charcoal-grey leather armor beneath a dark, hooded cloak. A silver leaf amulet with a sapphire hangs on a chain around his neck, and a hidden tattoo of ancient elven runes in a mysterious script, its meaning unknown to Vaelin and glowing faintly in the presence of magic, marks his chest over his heart.

### Personality Traits:
* Blends into any crowd, presence forgotten the moment of departure.
* A trustworthy smile hides a mind always planning three steps ahead.

### Ideals:
* Knowledge is the ultimate weapon.

### Bonds:
* The shadowy secret society ([[Factions/The_Society|The Society]]) saved a lost soul; loyalty is unwavering.
* [[Characters/NPCs/Talia_Whisper|Talia "Whisper"]] is like a big sister.
* [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]] is like a little sister.
* [[Characters/NPCs/Greta_Mama_Stoneheart|Greta "Mama" Stoneheart]] is maternal figure.
* [[Characters/NPCs/Elyndra|Elyndra]] is Vaelin's mentor within [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]].

### Flaws:
* An obsession with arcane secrets leads to reckless risks.

### Background Summary:
Vaelin Shadowleaf was born in [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]], a radiant high elf city of arcane splendor, its spires glowing with enchanted light and its halls filled with ancient wisdom. As a child, he witnessed its cataclysmic fall, triggered by a desperate pact with dragons—benevolent, neutral, and evil factions—that went awry, opening a rift to [[Lore/Cosmology/The_Nameless_Void|The Nameless Void]], a sanity-shattering cosmic horror. Amid blinding light and screams, Therandril collapsed, leaving Vaelin alone in [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]’s grim streets, clutching a **silver leaf amulet** etched with cryptic runes and adorned with a sapphire, and bearing a **runic tattoo** across his chest that glows faintly near [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]]-linked magic. Orphaned, he survived by scavenging and theft until caught pickpocketing by [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]], a secretive organization that trained him as a spy. Grateful yet wary, Vaelin serves [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]]’s enigmatic leaders, unaware of their role in [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]]’s destruction—a secret buried in their labyrinthine agenda. Driven by fragmented memories, he pursues arcane knowledge as a tool for thievery, a source of power, a key to his amulet and tattoo, and a bridge to [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]]’s lost past, navigating [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]’s dangers and [[Factions/The_Cult|The Cult]]’s [[Lore/Cosmology/The_Nameless_Void|Void]]-worshipping schemes.

Vaelin Shadowleaf operates within [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]], a secretive organization cloaked in mystery, where neither he nor most members grasp its full scope. [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]] functions as a labyrinth of veiled intentions, with only its enigmatic leaders holding the true knowledge of its goals. To Vaelin, it’s a shadowy benefactor that honed his skills as a thief and spy after a life of scavenging in [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]’s grim streets. Yet, he questions the shadows he serves, driven by a compulsion for arcane knowledge. This pursuit is fueled by practical needs (magic as a thief’s tool), a belief that knowledge is power, enigmatic runes on his silver leaf amulet and chest tattoo, and fleeting memories of [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]], his lost elven home. These threads—practicality, philosophy, and personal mystery—draw Vaelin deeper into [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]’s dangers, seeking answers that may illuminate or consume him.

* **Current Quest(s):**

## VIII. Character Aspirations & Future Goals

### Long-Term Personal Goals:
* Remain unknown among the criminal underclass of the city. He doen't want to be connected to my espionage or criminal activities. He will strive to remain a shadow, a ghost.
* Vaelin's espionage training with [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]] will progress as he gains skills in assassination (Assassin subclass) and wilderness espionage (Ranger (Gloom Stalker)).
* Vaelin's interest in arcane knowledge has been sparked by renewed interest in his chest tattoo, silver leaf amulet, and faint memories of his childhood in [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]]. His research will lead to an encounter with an [[Lore/Pantheon/Caladwen|Archfey entity]], becoming his patron when he multi-classes into [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Warlock_Class_2024|Warlock]] (Archfey Patron). The [[Lore/Pantheon/Caladwen|Archfey]] and his [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Familiar]] will mentor and guide him in his arcane and occult research, leading to future multi-classing into Wizard (Illusionist) and Artificer (Armorer). These magical abilities and knowledge not only aid him in espionage, but will help him solve the mysteries of his youth and [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]]. He also values them for their own sake.

### Desired Mechanical Progression:
* [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Warlock_Class_2024|Warlock]] 1 ([[Lore/Pantheon/Caladwen|Caladwen]] - Archfey Patron): Pact of the Chain ([[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]]), Pact of the Tome
    * story: patron and/or familiar is a mentor for magic and arcane knowledge
    * will obtain spells and invocations that aid espionage and arcane research
* Rogue (Assassin): Assassinate
    * story: training in spy-craft for espionage and assassination
* Ranger (Gloom Stalker) 5: Dread Ambusher, Umbral Sight, extra attack
    * story: training espionage in wilderness areas
* Fighter 2: action surge
* Wizard (Illusionist)
* Artificer (Armorer)

### Envisioned Character Arcs / Moral Shifts:
* (Do you have a specific moral or ethical journey in mind? e.g., "Shift from lawful good to chaotic good," "Struggle with temptation to use dark powers," "Learn to trust others after a betrayal.")

### Important Relationships to Cultivate/Resolve:
* (Are there specific NPCs or factions your character wants to build stronger ties with, reconcile with, or confront? e.g., "Befriend the reclusive sage [[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]]," "Resolve the conflict with my estranged sister," "Expose the corruption within the city guard.")
