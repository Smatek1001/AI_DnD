### Racial Traits ([[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Elf_Race_2024#C. High Elves|High Elf]]):
* **Ability Score Increase:** Dexterity +2, Intelligence +1 (already applied above)
* **Darkvision:** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.
* **Keen Senses:** You have proficiency in the Perception skill. (Already applied above.)
* **Fey Ancestry:** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
* **Trance:** Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is "trance." While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
* **Cantrip:** You know the _Prestidigitation_ cantrip. (As per your house rule, you start with Prestidigitation and can swap it after a long rest.) Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.

    * Spell Save DC: 11
    * Spell Attack Bonus: +3

## VI. Character Personality & Roleplaying

### Appearance:
A 5’11” [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Elf_Race_2024#C. High Elves|High Elf]] Rogue, Vaelin Shadowleaf moves with the graceful precision of a shadow. Fair skin and platinum blonde hair, tied back in a tight braid before missions, mark his elven heritage, but both are darkened with a disguise kit or a smear of dirt to blend seamlessly as a “grey man.” Hypnotic blue eyes, radiant as polished sapphires yet fathomless as an endless sea, mesmerize with an enchanting depth that betrays the “grey man” facade, drawing fleeting glances before a practiced smile redirects attention. A lean frame slips effortlessly into [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]’s crowds, clad in charcoal-grey leather armor beneath a dark, hooded cloak. A silver leaf amulet with a sapphire hangs on a chain around his neck, and a hidden tattoo of ancient elven runes in a mysterious script, its meaning unknown to Vaelin and glowing faintly in the presence of magic, marks his chest over his heart.

### Personality Traits:
* Blends into any crowd, presence forgotten the moment of departure.
* A trustworthy smile hides a mind always planning three steps ahead.

### Ideals:
* Knowledge is the ultimate weapon.

### Bonds:
* The shadowy secret society ([[Factions/The_Society|The Society]]) saved a lost soul; loyalty is unwavering.
* [[Characters/NPCs/Talia_Whisper|Talia "Whisper"]] is like a big sister.
* [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]] is like a little sister.
* [[Characters/NPCs/Greta_Mama_Stoneheart|Greta "Mama" Stoneheart]] is maternal figure.
* [[Characters/NPCs/Elyndra|Elyndra]] is Vaelin's mentor within [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]].

### Flaws:
* An obsession with arcane secrets leads to reckless risks.

### Background Summary:
Vaelin Shadowleaf was born in [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]], a radiant high elf city of arcane splendor, its spires glowing with enchanted light and its halls filled with ancient wisdom. As a child, he witnessed its cataclysmic fall, triggered by a desperate pact with dragons—benevolent, neutral, and evil factions—that went awry, opening a rift to [[Lore/Cosmology/The_Nameless_Void|The Nameless Void]], a sanity-shattering cosmic horror. Amid blinding light and screams, Therandril collapsed, leaving Vaelin alone in [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]’s grim streets, clutching a **silver leaf amulet** etched with cryptic runes and adorned with a sapphire, and bearing a **runic tattoo** across his chest that glows faintly near [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]]-linked magic. Orphaned, he survived by scavenging and theft until caught pickpocketing by [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]], a secretive organization that trained him as a spy. Grateful yet wary, Vaelin serves [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]]’s enigmatic leaders, unaware of their role in [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]]’s destruction—a secret buried in their labyrinthine agenda. Driven by fragmented memories, he pursues arcane knowledge as a tool for thievery, a source of power, a key to his amulet and tattoo, and a bridge to [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]]’s lost past, navigating [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]’s dangers and [[Factions/The_Cult|The Cult]]’s [[Lore/Cosmology/The_Nameless_Void|Void]]-worshipping schemes.

Vaelin Shadowleaf operates within [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]], a secretive organization cloaked in mystery, where neither he nor most members grasp its full scope. [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]] functions as a labyrinth of veiled intentions, with only its enigmatic leaders holding the true knowledge of its goals. To Vaelin, it’s a shadowy benefactor that honed his skills as a thief and spy after a life of scavenging in [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]’s grim streets. Yet, he questions the shadows he serves, driven by a compulsion for arcane knowledge. This pursuit is fueled by practical needs (magic as a thief’s tool), a belief that knowledge is power, enigmatic runes on his silver leaf amulet and chest tattoo, and fleeting memories of [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]], his lost elven home. These threads—practicality, philosophy, and personal mystery—draw Vaelin deeper into [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]’s dangers, seeking answers that may illuminate or consume him.

## VII. Current Status & Notes

## VIII. Character Aspirations & Future Goals

### Long-Term Personal Goals:
* Remain unknown among the criminal underclass of the city. He doen't want to be connected to my espionage or criminal activities. He will strive to remain a shadow, a ghost.
* Vaelin's espionage training with [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]] will progress as he gains skills in assassination (Assassin subclass) and wilderness espionage (Ranger (Gloom Stalker)).
* Vaelin's interest in arcane knowledge has been sparked by renewed interest in his chest tattoo, silver leaf amulet, and faint memories of his childhood in [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]]. His research will lead to an encounter with an [[Lore/Pantheon/Caladwen|Archfey entity]], becoming his patron when he multi-classes into [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Warlock_Class_2024|Warlock]] (Archfey Patron). The [[Lore/Pantheon/Caladwen|Archfey]] and his [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Familiar]] will mentor and guide him in his arcane and occult research, leading to future multi-classing into Wizard (Illusionist) and Artificer (Armorer). These magical abilities and knowledge not only aid him in espionage, but will help him solve the mysteries of his youth and [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]]. He also values them for their own sake.

### Desired Mechanical Progression:
* [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Warlock_Class_2024|Warlock]] 1 ([[Lore/Pantheon/Caladwen|Caladwen]] - Archfey Patron): Pact of the Chain ([[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]]), Pact of the Tome
    * story: patron and/or familiar is a mentor for magic and arcane knowledge
    * will obtain spells and invocations that aid espionage and arcane research
* Rogue (Assassin): Assassinate
    * story: training in spy-craft for espionage and assassination
* Ranger (Gloom Stalker) 5: Dread Ambusher, Umbral Sight, extra attack
    * story: training espionage in wilderness areas
* Fighter 2: action surge
* Wizard (Illusionist)
* Artificer (Armorer)

### Envisioned Character Arcs / Moral Shifts:
* (Do you have a specific moral or ethical journey in mind? e.g., "Shift from lawful good to chaotic good," "Struggle with temptation to use dark powers," "Learn to trust others after a betrayal.")

### Important Relationships to Cultivate/Resolve:
* (Are there specific NPCs or factions your character wants to build stronger ties with, reconcile with, or confront? e.g., "Befriend the reclusive sage [[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]]," "Resolve the conflict with my estranged sister," "Expose the corruption within the city guard.")
