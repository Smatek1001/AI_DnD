# Session Log - Dream Heist: Lord Malakor's Townhouse (2025-05-28)

## I. Summary of Events

Vaelin undertook a non-canonical dream heist into Lord Malakor's townhouse. He successfully navigated the property, picking the garden gate's rusted lock and the back door's intricate mechanism to gain entry. Inside, he investigated a grandfather clock, discovering a hidden compartment containing an exquisitely crafted brass key. This key was used to unlock a secret study. Within the study, Vaelin located his primary target, an ancient, jeweled music box, and further uncovered a hidden wall safe containing a magical gold locket. He also acquired approximately 150 gold pieces and two velvet pouches containing 200 gold pieces worth of uncut gems. The final discovery was a cryptic scroll detailing "whispers," "Veil's thinning," "the Cult," and the "Shade," all connected to Lord Malakor. Vaelin then silently slipped out of the study and ascended to the second floor, extinguishing a gas lamp and picking the lock of a bedroom where Lord Malakor slept soundly.

* **Hidden Compartments:** Discovered a hidden key in a grandfather clock (Investigation DC ??, roll 22), and used it to unlock a secret study. Found a hidden compartment behind books in the study, revealing a locket and scroll (Investigation DC ??, roll 20).
* **Stealth in Occupied House:** Successfully moved throughout the house, including past a sleeping occupant, with high Stealth rolls (22, 24).
* **Information Discovery:** Uncovered a cryptic scroll hinting at larger conspiracies related to "the whispers," "Veil's thinning," "the Cult," and "the Shade," implicitly connecting to Lord Malakor.

## IV. NPCs Encountered & Interactions

* **Lord Malakor:** [[Characters/NPCs/Lord_Varyn\|Lord Varyn]] (as a placeholder, though not explicitly stated to be him in the dream, the dream focused on "Lord Malakor" a reclusive collector in the Noble District). Encountered as a sleeping figure.

## VI. Quests Progress

* **Quests Advanced:** None
* **Quests Completed:** None
* **New Plot Hooks / Quests Uncovered:** The cryptic scroll's contents provide a potential plot hook for future canonical exploration related to [[Factions/The_Cult\|The Cult]], [[Lore/Cosmology/The_Nameless_Void\|The Nameless Void]], and perhaps [[Characters/NPCs/The_Shade\|The Shade]].

## VII. DM Notes (for your eyes only - for future reference)

This dream reinforced Vaelin's core skills and introduced subtle elements of the overarching cosmic horror plot. The discovery of the cryptic note, even in a dream, should resonate with Vaelin's obsession with arcane secrets and his past with Therandril. The "sun-etched metal" connection to the locket is a good lead. This dream could serve as a symbolic precursor to future real-world challenges or revelations. The experience of navigating a noble's house and finding hidden secrets adds to his perceived competency.
