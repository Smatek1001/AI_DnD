# Session Log - Dream Heist: Elias's Curios (2025-05-26)

## I. Summary of Events

Vaelin undertook a non-canonical dream mission, targeting "Elias's Curios & Sundries" for a ledger. He successfully infiltrated the shop by bypassing a robust back door secured with a standard padlock and an arcane alarm. Moving into the shop's office, he discovered a hidden compartment behind the desk, which was protected by a delicate thread alarm and a silent magical ward. After expertly disarming these, Vaelin opened the compartment to find a peculiar, humming ledger. An Arcana check revealed the ledger was steeped in dark, primordial magic, possibly tied to blood rites. Upon touching the ledger, Vaelin experienced a terrifying vision of cosmic horror and ancient cataclysm, including glimpses of a shattered crystalline city and a roaring dragon, before jolting awake in his hideout.

## III. Key Encounters & Decisions

* **Infiltration of Elias's Curios & Sundries:** Vaelin successfully bypassed the shop's security, first disarming an arcane alarm and picking a robust lock on the back door (DC 17 Arcana check for detection, DC 16 for picking). He then navigated a cluttered storage area with a high Stealth check (DC 15 against a 25 roll). In the office, he found and disarmed a hidden panel (DC 19 to detect, DC 18 to disarm) that concealed the target ledger.
* **Discovery of the Arcane Ledger:** Vaelin used an Arcana check (DC 16 against a 17 roll) to determine the ledger was infused with dark, primordial magic linked to blood rites, leading to unsettling visions upon contact.

## IV. NPCs Encountered & Interactions

* None in the dream.

## V. Locations Visited & Explored

* [[Locations/Abandoned_Bakery_Attic]]: Vaelin's starting and ending point for the dream.
* [[Elias's Curios & Sundries (Dream)]]: The primary location of the dream mission. A small shop with cluttered storage and a hidden office.

## VI. Quests Progress

* **Quests Advanced:** None (dream mission).
* **Quests Completed:** None (dream mission).
* **New Plot Hooks / Quests Uncovered:** The nature of the arcane ledger and its connection to cosmic horror and ancient cataclysms in the dream provides thematic plot hooks for future canonical play.

## VII. DM Notes (for your eyes only - for future reference)

This dream mission served to deepen Vaelin's connection to the cosmic horror elements and his past, particularly the fall of Therandril and the Nameless Void, without affecting canonical gameplay. The themes of grimdark reality, unsettling mysteries, and the blurred lines between reality and dream were successfully explored. The ledger provides a narrative echo that can be woven into future canonical events, possibly through mentions of similar artifacts or lore.
