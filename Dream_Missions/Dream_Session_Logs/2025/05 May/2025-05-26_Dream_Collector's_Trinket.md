# Session Log - The Collector's Trinket (Dream) (2025-05-26)

## I. Summary of Events

Vaelin found himself in a distorted, dream-like version of the Sewer Network, tasked with retrieving a "trinket of the forgotten" from "The Collector." He expertly navigated the initial dark passage and observed a cavern filled with grotesque, mechanical refuse and unsettling, angular crates. He successfully located the jade idol, the "trinket," hidden within a makeshift shelter. During his stealthy retreat, a stumble alerted a large, unseen creature, forcing him to hide. Through exceptional stealth, he evaded the creature, reaching his starting point and completing the mission, which automatically caused him to awaken.

## VII. DM Notes (for your eyes only - for future reference)

This dream was a good test of Vaelin's core skills (stealth, investigation, evasion) in a tense, grimdark setting. The "Collector" could be an interesting future NPC or faction in the canonical world, potentially linked to [[The Nameless Void]] due to the idol's shifting geometry and the general atmosphere. The creature encountered could be a common sewer inhabitant in a later canonical encounter.
