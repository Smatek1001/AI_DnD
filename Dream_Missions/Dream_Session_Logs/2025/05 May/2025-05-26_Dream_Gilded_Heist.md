# Session Log - The Gilded Heist (2025-05-26)

## I. Summary of Events

Vaelin undertook a dream mission to infiltrate Lord Varyn's manor in the High District and steal a gilded music box. After observing guard patrols and dealing with a magically reinforced study door, Vaelin used his Minor Illusion cantrip to create multiple diversions for the house guards. He discovered a hidden entrance to the study, bypassed it, and successfully acquired the music box without detection. He then used another illusion to cover his escape from the manor grounds, returning to his hideout safely within the dream.
