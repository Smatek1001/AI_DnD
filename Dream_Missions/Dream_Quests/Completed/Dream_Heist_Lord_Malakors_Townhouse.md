# Quest: Dream Heist: Lord Malakor's Townhouse

## I. Overview
* **Status:** completed
* **Category:** heist
* **Patron/Quest Giver:** Subconscious
* **Primary Location:** [[Locations/Noble_District\|Noble District]] (Lord Malakor's Townhouse)
* **Reward:** Insights, proficiency in stealth/thievery, cryptic lore
* **Priority:** low

## II. Quest Briefing
(From Vaelin's subconscious perspective) In a vivid dream, Vaelin was tasked with infiltrating the townhouse of Lord Malakor, a reclusive collector, to steal a valuable, jeweled music box.

## III. Goal & Objectives
* **Main Goal:** Infiltrate Lord Malakor's townhouse and steal the jeweled music box.
* **Key Objectives/Milestones:**
    * 1. Gain entry to the townhouse.
    * 2. Locate and acquire the music box.
    * 3. (Optional) Discover any other valuables or secrets.
    * 4. Escape undetected.

## IV. Parties Involved
* **Antagonists:**
    * Lord Malakor (sleeping occupant)
    * Townhouse Security (locks, potential hidden traps)
* **Allies/Key NPCs:** None (solo dream mission)
* **Relevant Monsters/Threats:** None

## V. Progress & Current Status
* **Current Stage:** Completed. Vaelin successfully infiltrated the townhouse, acquired the music box, a magical locket, gold, gems, and a cryptic scroll.
* **PC's Knowledge:** Vaelin successfully navigated sophisticated security, demonstrating high proficiency in stealth and thievery. He gained a cryptic scroll hinting at the "whispers," "Veil's thinning," "the Cult," and "the Shade," potentially linked to Lord Malakor and larger cosmic horrors.
* **Next Steps:** N/A (dream concluded)

## VI. Potential Complications & Twists
* The target might awaken.
* Hidden traps or unexpected magical defenses.
* Discovery of information more significant than the target item.

## VII. Resolution & Consequences
* **Success Scenario:** Vaelin successfully acquired the jeweled music box, a magical gold locket, gold, gems, and a cryptic scroll containing lore relevant to the campaign's cosmic horror elements. The dream provided valuable practice and psychological insights for Vaelin.
* **Failure Scenario:** (Not applicable, as success was achieved in the dream.)

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
This dream quest served to reinforce Vaelin's core skills and introduce subtle plot hooks regarding the Void, the Cult, and the "Veil's thinning" in a non-canonical context. The discovery of the locket and scroll adds psychological impact for Vaelin without altering his canonical inventory. This dream can be referenced in future canonical sessions if Vaelin's current quest involves similar themes or locations.
