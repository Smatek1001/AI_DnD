# Quest: The Gilded Heist

## I. Overview
* **Status:** completed
* **Category:** heist
* **Patron/Quest Giver:** Self (Dream)
* **Primary Location:** [[Lord Varyn's Manor (High District)]]
* **Reward:** None (dream mission)
* **Priority:** low

## II. Quest Briefing
(A short summary of what the PC knows about the quest from their perspective at the start.)
Vaelin embarked on a dream mission to infiltrate Lord Varyn's manor in the High District to steal a gilded music box rumored to contain valuable jewels and a ledger of illicit dealings. The mission was purely a non-canonical exercise in stealth and infiltration.

## III. Goal & Objectives
* **Main Goal:** Acquire the gilded music box from Lord Varyn's study and escape undetected.
* **Key Objectives/Milestones:**
    * 1. Observe Lord Varyn's manor for security measures and patrol routes.
    * 2. Gain undetected entry into the manor.
    * 3. Locate Lord Varyn's private study.
    * 4. Overcome any security on the study door (e.g., Arcane Lock, traps).
    * 5. Retrieve the gilded music box.
    * 6. Escape the manor and its grounds undetected.

## IV. Parties Involved
* **Antagonists:**
    * Lord Varyn (Target of the heist)
    * Lord Varyn's House Guards (Manor security)
    * Mastiffs (Guard dogs in the rear garden)
    * Arcane Lock (Magical security on the study door)
* **Allies/Key NPCs:**
    * None (solo dream mission)
* **Relevant Monsters/Threats:**
    * None (beyond human guards and mastiffs)

## V. Progress & Current Status
* **Current Stage:** Mission completed within the dream.
* **PC's Knowledge:** Vaelin successfully infiltrated Lord Varyn's manor, navigated its defenses, located the study via a hidden door, acquired the music box, and escaped unseen. He learned about the challenges of an Arcane Lock and the effectiveness of his Minor Illusion for distraction.
* **Next Steps:** None, as the mission was non-canonical and the dream has ended.

## VI. Potential Complications & Twists
(Ideas for how the quest could go wrong, unexpected developments, or moral dilemmas.)
* Guards discovering the illusion.
* Triggering an alarm or trap.
* Being detected inside the manor.
* Failure to bypass the Arcane Lock.

## VII. Resolution & Consequences
* **Success Scenario:** Vaelin successfully acquired the music box and escaped undetected within the dream. The experience serves as practice and a mental exercise for his skills.
* **Failure Scenario:** (Not applicable as the mission was successful.)

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
This dream mission was a successful test of Vaelin's stealth, observation, and magical application skills in a structured heist scenario. It allowed the player to practice and explore mechanics (Minor Illusion, Arcane Lock, hidden doors) without canonical consequences. Reinforces Vaelin's capabilities as a rogue/spy.
