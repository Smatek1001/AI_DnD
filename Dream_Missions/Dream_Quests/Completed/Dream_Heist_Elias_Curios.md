# Quest: Dream Heist: Elias's Curios

## I. Overview
* **Status:** completed
* **Category:** espionage
* **Patron/Quest Giver:** Subconscious Urge / Unseen Influence
* **Primary Location:** [[Dream_Missions/Dream_Locations/Elias_Curios_and_Sundries_Dream]]
* **Reward:** Insight into Cosmic Horror; No tangible reward.
* **Priority:** medium

## II. Quest Briefing
(A personal, subconscious directive to infiltrate a small curios shop and acquire a ledger, driven by an unexplainable urge for forbidden knowledge.)

## III. Goal & Objectives
* **Main Goal:** Infiltrate Elias's Curios & Sundries and acquire the ledger.
* **Key Objectives/Milestones:**
    * 1. Gain entry to Elias's Curios & Sundries.
    * 2. Locate the hidden ledger within the shop.
    * 3. Experience the revelations tied to the ledger.

## IV. Parties Involved
* **Antagonists:**
    * Shop's Security (Arcane and mechanical traps)
* **Allies/Key NPCs:**
    * None.
* **Relevant Monsters/Threats:**
    * Lingering influence of Cosmic Horror (The Nameless Void)

## V. Progress & Current Status
* **Current Stage:** Mission completed. Vaelin successfully infiltrated the shop, overcame its security, located and interacted with the ledger, and experienced profound, unsettling visions before waking.
* **PC's Knowledge:** Vaelin now has direct, experiential knowledge of an item deeply tied to dark, primordial magic, potentially linked to blood rites and cosmic horror. This experience is a "pseudo-canonical" dream, meaning it happened to Vaelin in his sleep and he retains the memory and psychological impact, but it does not physically affect the waking world.
* **Next Steps:** Integrate the psychological impact and thematic insights of this dream into Vaelin's character arc and future canonical encounters.

## VI. Potential Complications & Twists
(None relevant to this dream, as it concluded.)

## VII. Resolution & Consequences
* **Success Scenario:** Vaelin successfully infiltrated the shop and gained disturbing but valuable insight into a potent form of dark magic and its connection to cosmic horror. This experience deepens his understanding of the forces at play in his world and his own past.
* **Failure Scenario:** (Not applicable, as the mission was completed successfully.)

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
This quest serves as a direct exploration of cosmic horror themes within a non-canonical dream setting, providing Vaelin with unsettling "pseudo-canonical" knowledge. The emphasis was on stealth, investigation, and the psychological impact of the arcane item. It subtly reinforces the dangers of arcane secrets and the pervasive influence of The Nameless Void, directly tying into Vaelin's backstory. The surreal, rule-breaking nature of the dream was intentional.
