# Quest: The Collector's Trinket

## I. Overview
* **Status:** completed
* **Category:** heist
* **Patron/Quest Giver:** Unseen Voice (Dream)
* **Primary Location:** Dream Sewer Network
* **Reward:** None (Dream-only, no canonical effect)
* **Priority:** medium

## II. Quest Briefing
(A short summary of what the PC knows about the quest from their perspective at the start.)
Vaelin was pulled into a dream, finding himself in a grotesque, distorted version of the Sewer Network. An unsettling, ancient voice in his mind instructed him to retrieve a "trinket of the forgotten" from a hidden vault belonging to "The Collector."

## III. Goal & Objectives
* **Main Goal:** Retrieve the "trinket of the forgotten."
* **Key Objectives/Milestones:**
    * 1. Infiltrate The Collector's hidden vault in the dream-sewers.
    * 2. Locate and acquire the "trinket."
    * 3. Escape with the trinket (and awaken).

## IV. Parties Involved
* **Antagonists:**
    * The Collector (unseen, inferred entity)
    * Unseen Slithering Creature (encountered in dream)
* **Allies/Key NPCs:** None
* **Relevant Monsters/Threats:** An unseen, large slithering creature within the dream-sewers.

## V. Progress & Current Status
* **Current Stage:** Objective completed.
* **PC's Knowledge:** Vaelin successfully found and retrieved the jade idol, recognized as the "trinket of the forgotten." He evaded an unseen creature and awoke upon mission completion.
* **Next Steps:** None (mission completed, dream ended).

## VI. Potential Complications & Twists
* (e.g., "The artifact is cursed, and using it has unforeseen consequences.")
* (e.g., "The patron turns out to be evil.")

## VII. Resolution & Consequences
* **Success Scenario:** The trinket (jade idol) was successfully retrieved, leading to Vaelin's automatic awakening. No canonical effects.
* **Failure Scenario:** (Not applicable, as success achieved.)

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
This dream served as a test of Vaelin's core skills (Stealth, Investigation, Evasion) in a grimdark, unsettling environment. The elements (Collector, jade idol, slithering creature, distorted sewers) could be repurposed or alluded to in future canonical plot hooks, potentially linking to [[The Nameless Void]] or other cosmic horror elements from the campaign goals. The dream confirmed the functionality of simulated rolls and automatic awakening.
