# [Placeholder_Tolkien-esque_Female_Name]

## I. Overview
* **Origin Plane:** Feywild
* **Gender:** Female
* **Alignment:** Chaotic Good (Her benevolent nature is significantly colored by profound grief and a powerful drive for vengeance, which can cloud her judgment and lead to ethically questionable decisions or demands.)
* **Portfolio:** Former Guardian and known living Patron of the lost city of [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]]; a conduit for fey magic and ancient arcane knowledge; a seeker of vengeance against those responsible for Therandril's destruction; a sharer of Vaelin's sorrow.
* **Status:** Active, though her power may be focused or altered by her grief and the loss of Therandril.
* **Importance to Vaelin:** She serves as Vaelin Shadowleaf's Warlock patron, offering a direct and tangible link to his lost childhood, heritage, and the mysteries of Therandril. She is a mentor figure, guiding him towards avenging the city's fall.
* **Symbol:** [Describe Placeholder Symbol]

## II. Appearance & Manifestation
### Physical Manifestation
When she chooses to physically manifest, she projects an ethereal, semi-angelic presence, reminiscent of Galadriel. Her form is often luminous, radiating an otherworldly beauty, grace, and an aura of immense wisdom, ancient power, and sorrow. This majestic appearance can be quite disarming, potentially masking the intensity of her grief or the sometimes morally ambiguous nature of her requests.

## III. Personality & Demeanor
### Core Traits
Fundamentally benevolent and wise, her spirit is deeply scarred by the cataclysmic loss of [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]]. She shares this profound sense of loss with Vaelin. Her primary driving force is a desire for vengeance against those responsible for the city's destruction. This desire, while rooted in justice, can sometimes cloud her perspective, particularly regarding entities like [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]]. She is ancient, patient, but her grief can also make her demanding.
### Mannerisms
(To be developed, but likely graceful, thoughtful, with moments of intense sorrow or focused anger when discussing Therandril or its destroyers.)
### Ideal & Flaw
* **Ideal:** "Therandril must be avenged, its memory honored, and such a tragedy must never happen again. Those who stood by and allowed it will also answer."
* **Flaw:** "Her overwhelming grief and all-consuming desire for vengeance can warp her judgment, leading her to advocate for extreme measures or harbor deep-seated, potentially biased, resentment towards groups like The Society."

## IV. Background & History
She was an Archfey and the known, benevolent patron and a real, tangible presence in the ancient city of [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]], which existed on the border between the Material Plane and the Feywild. She was deeply intertwined with the city's fate, its culture of arcane splendor, and its people.

She witnessed Therandril's cataclysmic fall, resulting from a "desperate pact with dragons...that went awry, opening a rift to The Nameless Void." The specifics of her own actions during the fall, and why she was unable to prevent it, are likely a source of her profound sorrow and a mystery for Vaelin to uncover.

She holds [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]] at least partly accountable for the fall of [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]], believing their inaction or internal divisions contributed to the city's doom.

## V. Goals & Motivations
### Short-term Goals
* Forge a strong pact with [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]], seeing him as a conduit for her will and a champion for Therandril.
* Begin guiding Vaelin to uncover truths about Therandril's fall and the entities involved.
* Test Vaelin's resolve and capabilities.

### Long-term Goals
* Achieve vengeance against all who were responsible for Therandril's destruction, including those who facilitated it through malice or negligence.
* Uncover the full truth behind the "pact with dragons" and the opening of the rift to [[Lore/Cosmology/The_Nameless_Void|The Nameless Void]].
* Potentially find a way to restore some aspect of Therandril, heal the damage to the Feywild border, or ensure its memory is properly honored and its knowledge preserved.
* Serve as a magical mentor to Vaelin, drawing on Therandril's legacy as a center for arcane and esoteric knowledge.

### Primary Motivation
Vengeance for Therandril, profound grief, a desire for justice, and a protective, mentoring concern for Vaelin as a surviving child of her beloved city.

## VI. Relationships & Known Connections
* **[[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]:** Her chosen champion and warlock. She feels a deep connection to him due to his survival and his link to Therandril.
* **[[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]]:** The lost city she guarded and mourns.
* **[[Factions/The_Society|The Society]]:** Views them with suspicion and likely blames them, at least in part, for their failure to prevent Therandril's destruction. This will be a major point of potential conflict for Vaelin.
* **[[Lore/Cosmology/The_Nameless_Void|The Nameless Void]]:** The ultimate source of Therandril's catastrophic end; an entity of pure cosmic horror she likely despises and fears.
* **Dragons:** The "desperate pact with dragons" that went awry is a key element of Therandril's fall; her views on dragons, or specific dragon factions, would be significant.

## VII. DM Notes (for AI)
* She is intended to be Vaelin's Archfey Warlock Patron.
* Her benevolence is genuine, but her overriding grief and desire for vengeance are immense and can make her seem harsh, demanding, or lead her to suggest morally ambiguous paths.
* Her perspective on The Society's role in Therandril's fall is a critical plot point, creating a loyalty conflict for Vaelin.
* She should be a source of ancient lore, particularly concerning Therandril, the Feywild, and potentially the nature of the forces that destroyed the city.
* Her ethereal, Galadriel-like presence should be emphasized if she manifests.
* The interconnectedness of Vaelin's arcane pursuits, his past, his Warlock abilities, and his relationship with The Society should all be channeled through interactions or revelations involving her.
