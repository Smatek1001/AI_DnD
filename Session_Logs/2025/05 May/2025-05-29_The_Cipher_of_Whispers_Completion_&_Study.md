# Session Log - The Cipher of Whispers - Completion & Study (2025-05-29)

## I. Summary of Events

Vaelin completed the "The Cipher of Whispers" quest by delivering the acquired tome to [[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]] at the [[Locations/Shaded_Lantern|Shaded Lantern]]. In return, [[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]] provided foundational knowledge for contacting an Archfey patron, new insights into [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]] and [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]]'s glowing tattoo, and a **bone-and-silver stylus** to aid his studies. Upon returning to his [[Locations/Abandoned_Bakery_Attic|hideout]], [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]] immediately began studying the *Cipher of Whispers* with the aid of the new stylus, gaining a deeper understanding of its theoretical underpinnings regarding planar communion and cosmic energies. He plans to continue his studies into the evening.
