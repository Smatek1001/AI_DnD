# Session Log - The Archfey's Pact and Lirael's Awakening (2025-05-30)

## I. Summary of Events
At the dawn of Campaign Day 4, within the sacred grove of Sylvandell's Mirror, [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] successfully performed the "Call of the Threshold" ritual. He used his "Responsive Harmony" illusionary soundscape as an offering and utilized his [[Items/Bone_and_Silver_Stylus|Bone and Silver Stylus]] to aid the Arcana check (roll 22). This resulted in contact with the Archfey "[[Lore/Pantheon/Caladwen|Caladwen]]" (formerly known by the title The Weaver of Whispering Green).

[[Lore/Pantheon/Caladwen|Caladwen]] revealed her prior connection to [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]], confirming she was his savior from [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]] and the one who bestowed his runic tattoo. She acknowledged his stated purpose (to seek knowledge of [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]], answers to its fall, and vengeance) and offered a formal pact. [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]] accepted.

As a result of the pact, [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]] gained 100 XP, advancing to Character Level 2 (Rogue 1 / Warlock 1). [[Lore/Pantheon/Caladwen|Caladwen]] became his Archfey Patron. As a first gift, she dispatched [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]], a [[Bestiary/Flickerling|Flickerling]], to serve as his Pact of the Chain familiar (Invocation gained at Warlock Level 1 per 2024 Warlock rules being used).

[[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]] chose _Mage Hand_ (Legerdemain version) and _Minor Illusion_ as his Warlock cantrips. His High Elf racial cantrip for the day is _Prestidigitation_ (using Intelligence). He deferred choosing his two 1st-level Warlock spells.

The session concluded with [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]]'s initial interaction with [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]], stating his overarching goal to find "the secret of how to get back home."

(This session marked a major turning point for Vaelin with the Warlock pact and Lirael's arrival. The player's choices for cantrips are noted.
