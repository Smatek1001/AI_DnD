# Session Log - The Ratlings' Remedy and Arcane Preparations (2025-05-30)

## I. Summary of Events
This session spanned the entirety of Campaign Day 2 and concluded on the morning of Campaign Day 3.

**Campaign Day 2:**
The day began with [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]] urgently seeking [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]]'s aid in his [[Locations/Abandoned_Bakery_Attic|hideout]] to recover a stolen medicine box crucial for sick Ratlings. [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]] accepted the task. His investigation led him from the [[Locations/Shadow_Quarter|Shadow Quarter]] to the [[Locations/Rusty_Anchor|Rusty Anchor]] in the [[Locations/Docks|Docks]], where [[Characters/NPCs/Elara_Lark_Stoneheart|Elara "Lark" Stoneheart]] identified the likely thieves as "[[Characters/NPCs/Magpie_Miri|Magpie Miri]]'s" crew ([[Characters/NPCs/Grol|Grol]] & [[Characters/NPCs/Pip|Pip]]), suggesting they frequented the [[Locations/Old_Fishery|Old Fishery]] or the nearby [[Locations/Wharf_Rat's_Rest|Wharf Rat's Rest]].

[[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]] proceeded to the [[Locations/Old_Fishery|Old Fishery]]. After scouting its exterior, he infiltrated the cellars via a submerged passage. Inside, he located Miri, Grol, and Pip attempting to open the medicine box. He successfully used his _Minor Illusion_ cantrip to create a convincing auditory diversion (arguing goblins and gold), luring all three thieves away from their prize. Seizing the opportunity, [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]] snuck into their chamber, retrieved the medicine box and a crowbar they had been using. He then escaped the cellars by forcing open a trapdoor to the ground floor, closing it behind him, and exited the [[Locations/Old_Fishery|Old Fishery]] stealthily.

He returned to [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]] in his hideout, delivering the box and crowbar, and also offered some sweets for the sick Ratlings and a secure chest (managed by Finch) for their valuables.

Following the successful quest, [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]] dedicated the remainder of Campaign Day 2 to an intensive study of the *Cipher of Whispers* with his [[Items/Bone_and_Silver_Stylus|Bone and Silver Stylus]]. This yielded a significant breakthrough: he learned how to identify locations where the "veil between worlds is thin" (by observing subtle environmental phenomena) and discovered a meditative technique to enhance his senses for this purpose. He then practiced this technique.

**Campaign Day 3 (Morning):**
[[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]] completed a 4-hour elven trance (long rest), feeling refreshed. He contemplated his findings from the Cipher, deciding on an illusionary offering of a forest breeze and birdsong for the Archfey "The Weaver of Whispering Green." He resolved to spend Day 3 searching for a suitable ritual location outside [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]], planning to first visit [[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]] for guidance.
