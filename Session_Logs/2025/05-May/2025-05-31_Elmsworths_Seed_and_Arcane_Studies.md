# Session Log - Elmsworth's Seed and Arcane Studies (2025-05-31)

## I. Summary of Events
Vaelin, accompanied by his new familiar Lirael, undertook a minor heist suggested by her. They traveled from Sylvandell's Mirror to the secluded cottage of Elmsworth, a gnome collector. Using stealth, Lirael's scouting, and Vaelin's Mage Hand cantrip, Vaelin successfully retrieved a "Seed of Whispering Willows" from Elmsworth's cottage while the gnome napped. Vaelin learned the Seed could aid in delivering whispered messages and decided to keep it. They returned to Vaelin's hideout in the Shadow Quarter. Vaelin then spent time preparing components for three versatile "grey man" disguises. He gifted Lirael a magically shined brass button. The session concluded with Vaelin studying "The Faceless Art" for advanced disguise techniques and then entering his elven trance, ending Campaign Day 4 and beginning Day 5.
