# Session Log - Blackwood Recon & Arcane Studies (2025-06-02)

## I. Summary of Events
This session covered the remainder of Campaign Day 5's daylight hours. Vaelin began by leveraging "The Faceless Art" to improve three "grey man" disguises. He then met with Finch, who proposed a heist targeting Silas Blackwood, a miserly merchant, to recover owed gold and acquire other valuables. Vaelin had Lirael conduct extensive reconnaissance of "Blackwood's Baubles," gathering crucial intelligence on the shop's layout (front shop, back room with strongbox, upstairs living area with a warded box), guard presence, and potential magical items. He arranged for Finch's Ratlings to surveil the guards. Vaelin then visited Elaris at the Shaded Lantern, fulfilling a promise to provide her with a detailed account of his experiences in the Grove of Silver Trees and with Sylvandell's Mirror. Finally, Vaelin returned to his hideout and spent the afternoon using the bone-and-silver stylus to study the "Cipher of Whispers" (the tome Elaris provided), gaining deeper insights into Archfey patrons and their warlocks. The session concluded in the late afternoon/early evening as Vaelin awaits news from Finch before proceeding with the planned night-time heist on Blackwood's Baubles.
