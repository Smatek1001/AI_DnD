# Session Log - Warehouse Vigil and Torment (2025-06-05)

## I. Summary of Events
This session began late on Campaign Day 6 and concluded around midday on Campaign Day 7.

Following up on previous heists, Vaelin tasked Finch's Ratlings with locating Magpie Miri's gang after they fled their Old Fishery hideout. The Ratlings reported back (around 1:00 AM, Day 7) that Miri's crew had taken refuge in "The Sinking Stoat," a collapsed flophouse near the Wharf Rat's Rest.

Vaelin, disguised as a "Wharf Rat" and using _Disguise Self_, scouted The Sinking Stoat. He lured away stray dogs using _Prestidigitation_ and confirmed the gang was in the cellar. He then commenced a campaign of psychological torment:
* Used _Minor Illusion_ to create sounds of a whistling breeze, then faint whispers from within the cellar.
* After the gang was further unsettled, Lirael (as a squirrel) made a brief appearance to make them momentarily rationalize the noises as mundane.
* Vaelin then used _Prestidigitation_ to make it appear Pip had soiled his pants.

This led Miri to become convinced a person, a "twisted trickster," was targeting them. Vaelin then used _Minor Illusion_ to create the sound of footsteps fleeing from outside their cellar. Miri had Grol and Pip investigate; they found nothing. Miri then declared they would abandon the Sinking Stoat at dawn.

Vaelin continued to observe. As dawn approached (~6:30-7:00 AM, Day 7), Miri's gang prepared to leave. Vaelin instructed Lirael to follow them invisibly, while he trailed at a distance. After about an hour of searching (~8:00 AM), Miri's gang settled on a new potential hideout: an old, mostly collapsed warehouse at the edge of the Docks/Shadow Quarter, focusing on a collapsed loading chute for entry.

While Lirael monitored the gang's noisy efforts at the chute, Vaelin scouted the new warehouse's exterior. Lirael found a small, high grate she might use. Vaelin then found a weak spot on the warehouse's north wall and used his crowbar to create a discreet entrance into the ground floor. He explored inside, found a weak point in an office floor, and breached it to access a crawlspace below. From this crawlspace, he located a fissure providing a view into the specific cellar area Miri's gang was trying to enter via the chute.

Vaelin then concealed his office floor access point under a desk and box, used _Prestidigitation_ to cover his tracks, and re-camouflaged his exterior entry point. He returned to the crawlspace fissure. Just as Miri's gang broke through the chute into the target cellar, Vaelin warged into Lirael's senses. Lirael, from within the now-occupied cellar, scouted its interior for Vaelin, confirming his fissure was a good observation point and identifying a small, choked vent shaft high on a wall that she could potentially use.

Vaelin then had Lirael investigate the vent shaft (it was viable for her and led into the wall cavity/upwards). While she did this, Vaelin undertook a 4-hour elven trance in the crawlspace, completing a long rest (~8:00 AM - 12:00 PM, Midday, Day 7). Lirael reported that Miri's gang had fallen asleep in their new cellar during his trance.

The session concluded with Vaelin, now refreshed, deciding to have Lirael invisibly snoop through the sleeping gang's belongings in their new cellar hideout. [cite: 1625, 1639]

* **[[Locations/Abandoned_Warehouse_New_Hideout|Abandoned Warehouse (New Hideout)]]**: Exterior scouted by Vaelin & Lirael; Vaelin created an entry into the ground floor, explored, created access to a crawlspace, and found a fissure observing the cellar Miri's gang subsequently broke into. Vaelin took a long rest in the crawlspace.

## VI. Quests Progress
* **Side Objective (Harass Miri's Gang):** Significant progress. Gang is demoralized and has relocated. Vaelin has infiltrated their new lair.
* No official quests advanced or completed this session.

## VII. DM Notes
(This session involved extensive timeline corrections and clarifications. The focus was on Vaelin's meticulous planning, stealth, use of illusions for psychological effect, and familiar deployment. Good roleplaying of Vaelin's methodical approach to dismantling Miri's gang's sanity.)
