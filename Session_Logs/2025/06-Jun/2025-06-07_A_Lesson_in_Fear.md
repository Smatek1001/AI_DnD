# Session Log - A Lesson in Fear (2025-06-07)

## I. Summary of Events
This session took place over the course of Campaign Day 10. After learning from Finch that the "Rust Dogs" gang was threatening her Ratlings, Vaelin spent the day gathering intelligence. He spoke with Greta and Elara at the Rusty Anchor and an angry dwarven scrap hauler named Kaelen to learn the gang's key members (Gage, Maddox, Sparky) and their specific psychological weaknesses.

As night fell, Vaelin infiltrated the Ratlings' roost at the Cogsworth Tenement and lay in ambush. When the Rust Dogs arrived, he executed a masterful campaign of psychological warfare using his cantrips. He created a magical bonfire to prey on the leader Gage's pyrophobia, then used illusions to create a ghostly figure and whispers targeting Gage's past trauma. This caused Gage to have a complete mental breakdown, shattering the gang's morale.

After the terrified gang members scattered, abandoning their unconscious leader, Vaelin proceeded to their base, the Cinder-Shed. He used his cantrips to "haunt" the location, creating demonic graffiti and poltergeist-like effects to ensure the gang's reputation was destroyed and they would never return. The session concluded with Vaelin returning to his hideout for a long rest.
