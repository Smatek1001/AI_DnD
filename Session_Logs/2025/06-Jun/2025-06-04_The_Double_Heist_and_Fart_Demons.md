# Session Log - The Double Heist and Fart Demons (2025-06-04)

## I. Summary of Events

This session took place entirely on the late evening of Campaign Day 6.

Vaelin began the session seeking out [[Characters/NPCs/Finch\|Finch]] for a new lead on a criminal target. Finch provided a tip about a high-value gold transfer by the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild\|Nightshade Guild]] through the [[Locations/Veil\|Veil]] district via a courier.

Vaelin, disguised as a "Wharf Rat" and aided by his invisible familiar [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael\|Lirael]], infiltrated the [[Locations/Whispering_Door\|Whispering Door]] tavern. Through careful observation, he identified [[Characters/NPCs/Mira_Quickfingers\|Mira "Quickfingers"]], a halfling fence, as the courier, and discovered she was using magically concealed passages. Using [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael\|Lirael]]'s Misty Step and Fey Sight, Vaelin tracked Mira's precise route. With a perfectly timed distraction from Lirael (illusory sounds and smells) and a deft use of Mage Hand, Vaelin successfully snatched a satchel containing **2440 gold pieces** from Mira just as she was about to enter a waiting carriage. Mira's distress and subsequent public humiliation by [[Characters/NPCs/Vrenna\|Vrenna]] confirmed the success of the heist.

Not content, Vaelin immediately used Finch's intel to track down [[Characters/NPCs/Magpie_Miri\|Magpie Miri]] and [[Characters/NPCs/Grol\|Grol]] to the Salt Warehouse in the [[Locations/Docks\|Docks]], where they had just completed their own lucrative theft. In a display of creative vengeance, Vaelin initiated a prolonged "fart-demon" assault using _Minor Illusion_ and _Prestidigitation_, coupled with strategic Mage Hand slaps, causing Miri and Grol to descend into a disgusted, panicked argument. While they were utterly disoriented and blaming each other for the phantom foulness, Vaelin silently wheeled away their entire cart of loot, containing **3240 gold pieces**.

He then returned to his [[Locations/Abandoned_Bakery_Attic\|Abandoned Bakery Attic]] hideout, stashing both hauls of gold, bringing his total to a substantial **6378 gp**.

## VII. DM Notes (for your eyes only - for future reference)

This was an incredibly successful session for the PC, highlighting his rogue/warlock synergy for non-combat infiltration and theft. The use of Lirael was excellent. The two distinct heists provided a strong sense of progression and reward. Miri and Grol are now in a very desperate state, potentially leading them to take reckless actions in the future out of desperation. Mira "Quickfingers" is disgraced by the Guild and may now be an independent contact, perhaps seeking revenge on Vaelin or the Guild. The amount of gold gained is substantial and will need to be factored into future economic considerations for Vaelin.
