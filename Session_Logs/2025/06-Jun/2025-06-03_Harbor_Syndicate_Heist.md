# Session Log - Harbor Syndicate Heist (2025-06-03)

## I. Summary of Events

Vaelin Shadowleaf, seeking a lucrative score, consulted with [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]] of the [[Factions/Ratlings|Ratlings]] regarding a potential robbery target. Finch provided intel on [[Characters/NPCs/Garrick_Stonehand|Garrick Stonehand's]] shop in the [[Locations/Market_Square|Market Square]], noting it was under heavy [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]] surveillance due to Garrick's outstanding debts. Vaelin, desiring a larger haul and a chance to "pick on the bigger bully," decided to target the Syndicate's take directly.

Using his 'grey man' disguise, a magically enhanced illusion from [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Mask of Many Faces]], and the stealth provided by his newly attuned [[Items/Locket_of_Silent_Passage|Locket of Silent Passage]], Vaelin, with [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]] providing aerial reconnaissance, scouted Garrick's shop. He confirmed the Syndicate's strong presence, including [[Characters/NPCs/Brak|Brak]] and other thugs, effectively locking down the area.

Observing from a hidden vantage point, Vaelin waited as the Syndicate crew initiated their forceful debt collection on Garrick Stonehand. Once the physical altercation began, Vaelin cunningly employed multiple uses of his invisible [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Mage Hand]] to repeatedly slap the Syndicate members, framing one against the other, and eventually causing [[Characters/NPCs/Brak|Brak]] to turn his rage on his own men. As the Syndicate descended into a violent internal brawl, Vaelin seized the opportunity, stealthily snatching the heavy sack of gold from the distracted thug's grasp. He then performed one final, perfectly timed slap on Brak, again framing the thug, as he melted back into the shadows. Vaelin made a clean escape, leaving the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]] crew in complete pandemonium, beating each other over perceived betrayals.

Upon returning to his [[Locations/Abandoned_Bakery_Attic|hideout]], Vaelin counted the haul, finding a substantial 750 gold pieces. He set aside 75 gold pieces as the [[Factions/Ratlings|Ratlings']] cut and stashed the remainder in his hidden compartments.

## III. Key Encounters & Decisions

* **Decision to target Syndicate's take:** Vaelin chose to actively engage with the more powerful [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]] rather than the initial, smaller target, showing a preference for higher stakes and outwitting "bigger bullies."
* **Orchestration of distraction:** Vaelin successfully used [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Mage Hand]] and [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Deception]] to create a violent internal conflict among the Syndicate thugs, a complex and risky maneuver that paid off.
* **Stealthy acquisition:** Successfully stole the gold directly from the Syndicate's grasp amidst their chaos.

## IV. NPCs Encountered & Interactions

* [[Characters/NPCs/Finch]]: Provided crucial initial reconnaissance and intel on the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Syndicate's]] presence. Received 10% cut of the profits.
* [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael]]: Provided invaluable aerial reconnaissance and silent warnings throughout the observation and heist.
* [[Characters/NPCs/Garrick_Stonehand]]: Observed by Vaelin as the target of the Syndicate's debt collection. His fear and anxiety were evident.
* [[Characters/NPCs/Skarlix]]: Mentioned by Finch as having visited Garrick's shop.
* [[Characters/NPCs/Brak]]: Directly involved in the Syndicate's show of force and subsequently ensnared in Vaelin's distraction, leading to his furious assault on his own men.

## V. Locations Visited & Explored

* [[Locations/Abandoned_Bakery_Attic]]: Vaelin's hideout, used for preparation and securing the loot.
* [[Locations/Shadow_Quarter]]: Navigated to meet Finch and access the Market Square.
* [[Locations/Market_Square]]: The primary location of the heist, where Garrick's shop is located and the Syndicate operation unfolded.
* [[Locations/Syndicate_Warehouse]]: The ultimate destination of the Syndicate's haul, though Vaelin intercepted it en route.

## VI. Quests Progress

* **Quests Advanced:** None explicitly, but Vaelin successfully completed a side quest for personal gain.
* **Quests Completed:**
    * (New Side Quest) Robbery of the Harbor Syndicate's Extortion Haul: Successfully completed.
* **New Plot Hooks / Quests Uncovered:**
    * The [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]] will likely be seeking answers regarding the chaotic brawl and the disappearance of their gold. This could lead to future conflicts or investigations into Vaelin (if he's identified) or other criminal elements.

## VII. DM Notes (for your eyes only - for future reference)

This was a highly successful side quest that showcased Vaelin's rogue and warlock skills effectively. The *Mage Hand* distraction was executed perfectly and led to great narrative chaos. The Syndicate will be very confused and angry, likely blaming each other for the incident for some time before they consider external interference. This provides a great opportunity for future plot hooks involving their internal power struggles or their eventual hunt for an unknown perpetrator.
