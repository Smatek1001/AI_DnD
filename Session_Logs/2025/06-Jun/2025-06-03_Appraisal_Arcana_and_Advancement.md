# Session Log - Appraisal, Arcana, and Advancement (2025-06-03)

## I. Summary of Events
Vaelin Shadowleaf began Campaign Day 6 by finishing a long rest (Trance) in his hideout, restoring his Warlock spell slot. He then met with [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]] in the [[Locations/Shadow_Quarter|Shadow Quarter]], confirming the payment for the Ratlings from the Blackwood heist was in the hideout and discussing the discovery of a mysterious parchment signed by "Magister Vayne" which mentioned an "Oculus Array," "Resonance Core," "Therandran Protocol," and the "Night of Whispers." Finch agreed to have her Ratlings listen for any related street rumors.

Vaelin then proceeded to the [[Locations/Shaded_Lantern|Shaded Lantern]] in the [[Locations/Veil|Veil]] to speak with [[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]]. He requested a lead-lined chest and inquired about any available tasks. Elaris offered a quest: deliver a sealed box containing an ancient elven artifact to Alistair Finchley, a specialist in linguistic esoterica, for assessment and return the findings.

Vaelin accepted and traveled to Alistair Finchley's secluded study in the Old Salt's Tenements area of the [[Locations/Docks|Docks]]. After a meticulous examination, Finchley identified the artifact as a fragment of proto-Seldarine script, possibly a dormant ward of familial protection related to the "House of Silent Stars" and keyed to a specific bloodline or location.

Vaelin returned to [[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]] with the artifact and Finchley's assessment. As a reward, Elaris covered the cost of procuring the lead-lined chest and gave Vaelin 75 gold pieces. This amounted to 150 XP, allowing Vaelin to reach Character Level 3. He chose to advance his Warlock class to Level 2.

Back in his hideout, Vaelin spent 100 gp on a pearl and conjured his Pact of the Tome *Book of Shadows* (generic appearance for now). Over the next nearly two hours, he ritually cast *Identify* on all eleven magical items recovered from the Blackwood's Baubles heist. He then stowed most of the items in the identified "Secure Transit Casket," choosing to wear the "Locket of Silent Passage" and keep the "Shadow-Shaper's Shard" on his person.
