# Session Log - The Blackwood Heist (2025-06-02)

## I. Summary of Events
This session covered the late evening of Campaign Day 5 and the early morning hours of Campaign Day 6. [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]], after planning with [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]], undertook a solo heist of "[[Locations/Blackwood's_Baubles|Blackwood's Baubles]]," a jeweler and specialty goods shop.

Key events included:
* Finalizing the heist plan with Finch, opting for a solo infiltration without Ratling diversion.
* Vaelin choosing *Hex* and *Hellish Rebuke* as his initial Warlock spells.
* Observing Blackwood closing up shop and retiring for the night. [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]] confirmed Blackwood was asleep.
* Vaelin used Prestidigitation to create a foul odor in the workshop, luring the inside guard to open the back window and retreat from the smell.
* Vaelin then used Mage Hand to retrieve a warded wooden box (containing the "Oculus Array" - Clockwork Lenses, "Resonance Core" - Sealed Lacquer Cylinder, and Dried Dark Herbs) from the workshop. He also retrieved an Obsidian Gemstone from the workshop windowsill.
* Lirael later scouted the upstairs study (finding loose coins and a locked iron strongbox) and Blackwood's bedroom (finding a magically warded chest under the bed, which Vaelin decided to leave).
* Vaelin personally infiltrated the shop: collected workshop coins, cast *Hex* on the sleeping inside guard, picked the lock on the till and took ~9-10gp, investigated other drawers (opening one with a hidden catch to find a Deck of Divination Cards and a jeweler's loupe, and another containing customer repair items after picking its lock). He also collected an Illusion Hand-Mirror and a Transmutation Locket Lirael had previously scouted in the front shop.
* Vaelin successfully exfiltrated the shop with Lirael and returned to his [[Locations/Abandoned_Bakery_Attic|hideout]].
* Back at the hideout, Vaelin examined a parchment found in the study's strongbox, revealing it to be instructions from "Magister Vayne" to Blackwood concerning the "Oculus Array" and "Resonance Core."
* Vaelin set aside 20gp on Finch's designated chest in his hideout (to repay the 15gp fronted for Ratling services plus a 5gp bonus) and stashed the remainder of his considerable haul.

## VII. DM Notes (for your eyes only - for future reference)
(This was a very successful stealth and acquisition focused session. Vaelin's skills were well utilized. The information from the parchment opens up significant future plot threads. The player's clarifications on Lirael's scouting and past events were very helpful for maintaining continuity.)
