# Session Log - Magpie Miri Harassment Campaign Concludes (2025-06-05)

## I. Summary of Events

Vaelin Shadowleaf continued his relentless psychological and physical torment of **Magpie Miri's gang**. From his crawlspace hideout in the Abandoned Warehouse, he first subtly improved their meager breakfast with **Prestidigitation**, causing bewildered enjoyment before they stole it from a market stall. After they stole it, Vaelin paid the bakery couple extra to cover their losses.

He then shadowed the gang to **Garrick Stonehand's** shop, where Vaelin's earlier warning had led Garrick to hire guards. During a confrontation, Vaelin initiated a brawl by making it appear Garrick had slapped Miri with **Mage Hand** and mocked her with a **Minor Illusion**. This enraged Miri, leading to **Pip** fleeing in terror. **Miri** and **Grol** were then severely beaten **unconscious** by **Skarlix** and **Brak** of the **Harbor Syndicate**, and left abandoned in the Docks alley.

While Miri and Grol were recovering in their hideout, Vaelin retrieved a mysterious **Obsidian Orb** from a puzzle box they had found at the **Red Rooster Courtyard**. Lirael, unseen, revealed the orb's alien, primordial magical nature and its resonance with Vaelin's own tattoo.

Vaelin observed Miri and Grol's slow, agonizing recovery before they managed to drag themselves back to their hideout. He then returned to his own hideout, having filled **Finch** in on the complete downfall and decimation of Magpie Miri's gang.

    * The potential long-term repercussions from the **Harbor Syndicate** due to the humiliation of Skarlix and Brak (even if they don't know the exact source).

## VII. DM Notes (for your eyes only - for future reference)
* **Miri and Grol's Fate:** They are alive but severely injured and utterly broken. They will likely be found by the City Watch, or other vagrants, perhaps even taken in by a compassionate soul (or a predatory one). They are out of the game as active antagonists for now.
* **Obsidian Orb:** This object is a significant mystery and potential link to cosmic horror elements or Vaelin's backstory. Create a new `Items/Obsidian_Orb.md` file.
* **Red Rooster Courtyard:** Create a new `Locations/Red_Rooster_Courtyard.md` file.
* **Harbor Syndicate Reaction:** Skarlix's pride is utterly shattered, and he believes Miri was the source of the ultimate insults. This will fuel a deep, unhinged hatred for her and potentially the rest of her (non-existent) gang. The Syndicate will be furious, but the direct source of the advanced torment remains unknown to them.
* **Next Session Focus:** What will Vaelin do next after this successful harassment campaign? His long-term goals of arcane research and understanding his past are open. The Obsidian Orb provides a new, tangible lead.

# Item: Obsidian Orb

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Wondrous Item
* **Rarity:** Uncommon
* **Requires Attunement:** false
* **Source/Origin:** Found within a puzzle box buried in the [[Red_Rooster_Courtyard|Red Rooster Courtyard]].
* **Current Owner:** [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]
* **Status:** active

## II. Description
A small, smooth sphere about the size of a pigeon's egg, crafted from what appears to be polished obsidian. It radiates a faint, pulsing inner light â€“ a deep, unsettling violet hue. It feels cool to the touch and resonates with a faint, almost imperceptible thrum.

## III. Properties & Abilities
* **Resonance:** The orb subtly resonates with the energy around Vaelin's own runic tattoo, creating a faint, familiar thrum in his chest when near.
* **Alien Aura:** Possesses a magical aura that is difficult to categorize, feeling less like a conventional spell and more like a captured fragment of something vast, ancient, and alien. Lirael perceives its magic as "primordial" and "foreign to this world."
* **No Obvious Powers:** At current, the orb does not seem to have any overt powers or functions beyond its strange resonance and aura. Its purpose remains a mystery.

## IV. Lore & History
Discovered in a heavily corroded bronze puzzle box in the forgotten **Red Rooster Courtyard**, where it was presumably hidden long ago. Its strange, alien nature suggests it is much older than its current resting place. Its connection to Vaelin's tattoo hints at deeper, forgotten lore.

## V. Plot Hooks & Secrets
* **Known Secrets:** Its appearance, its alien magical aura, and its resonance with Vaelin's tattoo.
* **Hidden Secrets:** Its true origin, its purpose, its connection to [[Lore/Cosmology/The_Nameless_Void|The Nameless Void]] or [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]], and any latent powers it may hold.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Could be a key to understanding Vaelin's past or the runes on his tattoo; might be sought by other factions interested in ancient or alien magic (e.g., [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]], [[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]], [[Factions/The_Cult|The Cult]]); its powers might be unlocked through arcane research or by bringing it to specific locations.

## VI. DM Notes (for AI)
This orb is a subtle, long-term plot hook. Its resonance with Vaelin's tattoo is important. It should not have any immediate, obvious combat or utility powers, driving Vaelin to research and explore its mysteries. Its magic should continue to feel "alien" and not fit neatly into D&D's standard magical schools. Its true rarity and attunement status can be determined once its full powers are unlocked.
