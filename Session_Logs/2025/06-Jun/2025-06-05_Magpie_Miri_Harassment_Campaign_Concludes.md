# Session Log - Magpie Miri Harassment Campaign Concludes (2025-06-05)

## I. Summary of Events

Vaelin Shadowleaf continued his relentless psychological and physical torment of **Magpie Miri's gang**. From his crawlspace hideout in the Abandoned Warehouse, he first subtly improved their meager breakfast with **Prestidigitation**, causing bewildered enjoyment before they stole it from a market stall. After they stole it, Vaelin paid the bakery couple extra to cover their losses.

He then shadowed the gang to **Garrick Stonehand's** shop, where Vaelin's earlier warning had led Garrick to hire guards. During a confrontation, Vaelin initiated a brawl by making it appear Garrick had slapped Miri with **Mage Hand** and mocked her with a **Minor Illusion**. This enraged Miri, leading to **Pip** fleeing in terror. **Miri** and **Grol** were then severely beaten **unconscious** by **Skarlix** and **Brak** of the **Harbor Syndicate**, and left abandoned in the Docks alley.

While Miri and Grol were recovering in their hideout, Vaelin retrieved a mysterious **Obsidian Orb** from a puzzle box they had found at the **Red Rooster Courtyard**. Lirael, unseen, revealed the orb's alien, primordial magical nature and its resonance with Vaelin's own tattoo.

Vaelin observed Miri and Grol's slow, agonizing recovery before they managed to drag themselves back to their hideout. He then returned to his own hideout, having filled **Finch** in on the complete downfall and decimation of Magpie Miri's gang.

## V. Locations Visited & Explored
* [[Locations/Abandoned_Warehouse_New_Hideout|Abandoned Warehouse (New Hideout)]]: Vaelin's observation post, Miri and Grol's hideout.
* [[Locations/Market_Square|Market Square]]: Garrick's shop, bakery stall.

* The Docks alleys: Main area for pursuits and observation.
* **Red Rooster Courtyard**: Location of the puzzle box. (This will need a new Location file).

## VI. Quests Progress
* **Quests Advanced:** None specific.
* **Quests Completed:**
    * **Magpie Miri Harassment Campaign (Player-Driven Objective):** The gang has been completely disrupted and neutralized.
* **New Plot Hooks / Quests Uncovered:**
    * The nature and purpose of the [[Items/Obsidian_Orb|Obsidian Orb]].
    * The continued unknown fate of **Pip**.
    * The potential long-term repercussions from the **Harbor Syndicate** due to the humiliation of Skarlix and Brak (even if they don't know the exact source).

## VII. DM Notes (for your eyes only - for future reference)
* **Miri and Grol's Fate:** They are alive but severely injured and utterly broken. They will likely be found by the City Watch, or other vagrants, perhaps even taken in by a compassionate soul (or a predatory one). They are out of the game as active antagonists for now.
* **Obsidian Orb:** This object is a significant mystery and potential link to cosmic horror elements or Vaelin's backstory. Create a new `Items/Obsidian_Orb.md` file.
* **Red Rooster Courtyard:** Create a new `Locations/Red_Rooster_Courtyard.md` file.
* **Harbor Syndicate Reaction:** Skarlix's pride is utterly shattered, and he believes Miri was the source of the ultimate insults. This will fuel a deep, unhinged hatred for her and potentially the rest of her (non-existent) gang. The Syndicate will be furious, but the direct source of the advanced torment remains unknown to them.
* **Next Session Focus:** What will Vaelin do next after this successful harassment campaign? His long-term goals of arcane research and understanding his past are open. The Obsidian Orb provides a new, tangible lead.
