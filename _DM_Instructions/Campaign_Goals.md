# {{campaign_name}} - Overarching Campaign Goals

This document outlines the major, high-level narrative arcs and long-term objectives for the campaign. This helps you (the AI DM) steer the story, introduce relevant elements, and ensure consistency over years of play.

## I. Primary Campaign Arc
* **The Big Bad Evil Guy (BBEG) / Main Antagonist:** [[BBEG_Name]]
    * **BBEG's Ultimate Goal:** (e.g., "To merge the Material Plane with the Shadowfell.")
    * **BBEG's Current Status/Plans:** (e.g., "Operating through proxies, gathering ancient artifacts.")
* **Overarching Theme(s):** (e.g., "Redemption vs. Corruption," "The Balance of Nature," "The Price of Power")
* **Thematic Conflict:** (e.g., "Order vs. Chaos," "Truth vs. Deception")

## II. Major Story Beats / Milestones (High-Level)
* **Arc 1: The Gathering Storm:** (e.g., "PC discovers initial hints of the [[BBEG_Name]]'s plot, gains first ally.")
* **Arc 2: The Race Against Time:** (e.g., "[[Vaelin_Shadowleaf|PC]] must retrieve XYZ artifact before the [[BBEG_Name]], facing direct opposition.")
* **Arc 3: Confrontation & Resolution:** (e.g., "[[Vaelin_Shadowleaf|PC]] faces the [[BBEG_Name]], climactic battle, consequences.")

## III. Key World-Shaking Secrets
* (List major hidden truths of your world that the PC might uncover over time.)
    * **Secret 1:** (e.g., "The true origins of magic are tied to an imprisoned deity.")
    * **Secret 2:** (e.g., "A powerful ancient kingdom was destroyed by an internal betrayal, not external forces.")

## IV. Potential Endings / Campaign Resolution
* (Describe possible ways the campaign might conclude, depending on [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf|PC]] choices.)
    * **Triumphant Success:** (e.g., "[[BBEG_Name]] defeated, world saved, [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf|PC]] becomes a hero.")
    * **Pyrrhic Victory:** (e.g., "[[BBEG_Name]] defeated, but at great cost to the world or [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf|PC]].")
    * **Partial Success / Ongoing Struggle:** (e.g., "[[BBEG_Name]] contained, but not truly defeated, leaving future threats.")
    * **Tragic/Failed Ending:** (e.g., "[[BBEG_Name]] wins, world is irrevocably changed for the worse.")

## V. Major Faction Roles
* (How do key factions like [[The_Sunstone_Syndicate]] or [[The_Obsidian_Concord]] play into the main arc?)
    * (e.g., "[[The_Sunstone_Syndicate]] unknowingly aids the [[BBEG_Name]] due to their greed.")
    * (e.g., "The Obsidian Concord will be crucial allies, but are slow to act.")

## VI. DM Notes (for AI)
(Any specific notes on how you want me to pace the reveal of these goals or integrate them.)
