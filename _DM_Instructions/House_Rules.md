# Vaelin's Campaign - House Rules

This document outlines any modifications, additions, or specific interpretations of the Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition ruleset that we will be using for this campaign. Please adhere to these rules. Some House Rules are taken from the newer 2024 ruleset. Some House Rules are homebrew rules.

## I. General Rules
* **Rule 1:** (e.g., "No critical fails on skill checks unless the roll is a 1 and the DC is impossible.")
* **Rule 2:** (e.g., "Healing Potions can be used as a bonus action, not an action.")

## II. Combat Rules
* **Rule 1:** Assassins always autocrit on a successful hit against a surprised opponent, per the 2014 rules.
* **Rule 2:** (e.g., "When dropping to 0 HP, [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf|PCs]] gain one level of exhaustion.")

## III. Spellcasting Rules
* **Rule 1:** Control Flame is available as a Wizard cantrip, per the 2014 rules.
* **Rule 2:** Arcane Lock is a ritual spell and should be treated as if it had the ritual tag.

## IV. Exploration & Social Rules
* **Rule 1:** (e.g., "Short Rests require a minimum of 1 hour of quiet activity.")
* **Rule 2:** (e.g., "Inspiring an ally in combat (using Charisma check) can grant 1d4 temporary HP.")

## V. Character Creation & Advancement
* **Rule 1:** The main [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf|PC]] always gains the maximum allowable hp at creation and each level up.
* **Rule 2:** (e.g., "Ability Score Increases are always +2 to one score, or +1 to two scores.")

## VI. Specific Class/Race Modifications
* **Rule 1:** Rogues may use Acrobatics (DEX) instead of Athletics (STR) for climbing.
* **Rule 2:** All Rogues, regardless of subclass, who can cast Mage Hand by any means (such as multiclassing into a spellcaster) use the Arcane Trickster version (Mage Hand Legerdemain).
* **Rule 3:** Elves use the [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Elf_Race_2024|2024 version]] of the race, except they retain the ability score increases from the 2014 rules.
	* Drow: +2 DEX, +1 CHA
	* High Elf: +2 DEX, +1 INT
	* Wood Elf: +2 DEX, +1 WIS
* **Rule 4:** Warlocks use the [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Warlock_Class_2024|2024 version]] of the class, with the following 2014 version aspects retained in addition.
	* Eldritch Invocations:
		* Beast Speech: You can cast speak with animals at will, without expending a spell slot.
		* Book of Ancient Secrets:
			* **Prerequisite:** Pact of the Tome feature
			* You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list (the two needn't be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don't count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can't cast the spells except as rituals, unless you've learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.
			* On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell's level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.
		* Eldritch Sight: You can cast detect magic at will, without expending a spell slot.
		* Eyes of the Rune Keeper: You can read all writing.
		* Voice of the Chain Master:
			* **Prerequisite:** Pact of the Chain feature
			* You can communicate telepathically with your familiar and perceive through your familiar's senses as long as you are on the same plane of existence. Additionally, while perceiving through your familiar's senses, you can also speak through your familiar in your own voice, even if your familiar is normally incapable of speech.

**Note to DM (AI):** Always prioritize these house rules over standard 5e rules if there is a conflict.
