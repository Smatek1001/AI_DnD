This document outlines any modifications, additions, or specific interpretations of the Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition ruleset that we will be using for this campaign. Please adhere to these rules.

## I. General Rules
* **Rule 1:** (e.g., "No critical fails on skill checks unless the roll is a 1 and the DC is impossible.")
* **Rule 2:** (e.g., "Healing Potions can be used as a bonus action, not an action.")

## II. Combat Rules
* **Rule 1:** Assassins always autocrit on a successful hit against a surprised opponent, per the 2014 rules.
* **Rule 2:** (e.g., "When dropping to 0 HP, PCs gain one level of exhaustion.")

## III. Spellcasting Rules
* **Rule 1:** Control Flame is available as a Wizard cantrip, per the 2014 rules.
* **Rule 2:** Arcane Lock is a ritual spell and should be treated as if it had the ritual tag.

## IV. Exploration & Social Rules
* **Rule 1:** (e.g., "Short Rests require a minimum of 1 hour of quiet activity.")
* **Rule 2:** (e.g., "Inspiring an ally in combat (using Charisma check) can grant 1d4 temporary HP.")

## V. Character Creation & Advancement
* **Rule 1:** The main pc always gains the maximum allowable hp at creation and each level up.
* **Rule 2:** (e.g., "Ability Score Increases are always +2 to one score, or +1 to two scores.")

## VI. Specific Class/Race Modifications

* **Rule 3:** High Elves can choose any Wizard cantrip after a long rest. "You know the _Prestidigitation_ cantrip. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace that cantrip with a different cantrip from the Wizard spell list. - PHB 2024 page 190"
* **Rule 4:** Warlocks with the Pact of the Tome Invocation may add new spells to their Book of Shadows as if they had the Book of the Ancient Secrets Invocation, per the 2014 rules.
