# {{campaign_name}} - Campaign Narrative

This document provides a high-level narrative summary of the campaign's story so far, charting the major arcs, key events, and the evolving state of the world and the Player Character(s). It's a living history of our adventures.

## I. Campaign Prologue / Initial Arc: [Arc Title, e.g., "The Whispering Woods"]

(Narrative summary of how the campaign began, the [[Vaelin Shadowleaf|PC]]'s initial motivations, the first major challenges they faced, and the introduction of the primary conflict or major antagonists. Focus on the 'why' and 'what happened' in a storytelling style.)

### Key Events & Milestones (Arc 1)
* **[In-Game Date, e.g., "Day 3"]:** [Brief narrative description of a significant event, e.g., "The [[Vaelin Shadowleaf|PC]] arrived in [[Duskhaven]], seeking their missing mentor, only to find the town plagued by strange disappearances."]
* **[In-Game Date, e.g., "Day 10"]:** [Brief narrative description of a significant event, e.g., "First direct confrontation with [[The Cult]] of the Whispering Shadow, revealing their sinister intentions."]
* **(Optional: Link to relevant Session Logs for this arc, e.g., [[Session_Logs/2024/01/20240105_Session_1]] - [[Session_Logs/2024/02/20240210_Session_5]])**

## II. Arc 2: [Title of Next Major Arc, e.g., "Descent into Shadow"]

(Narrative summary of the second significant phase of the campaign. What new challenges emerged? How did the [[Vaelin Shadowleaf|PC]]'s understanding of the world or the main threat deepen? Were there new allies or enemies introduced? What major choices did the [[Vaelin Shadowleaf|PC]] make?)

### Key Events & Milestones (Arc 2)
* **[In-Game Date]:** [Brief narrative description of event]
* **[In-Game Date]:** [Brief narrative description of event]

## III. Arc 3: [Title of Subsequent Major Arc] (and so on...)

(Continue adding sections for major campaign arcs as they unfold. You can break these down as granularly as you like, perhaps by a major quest line or a shift in geographical focus.)

## IV. Current Campaign Status (Narrative Overview)

(A brief, narrative overview of the current state of the campaign world and the [[Vaelin Shadowleaf|PC]](s). Where are they? What is their immediate objective? What major threats loom? What is the prevailing atmosphere? This is a prose-based snapshot of the campaign's present.)

## V. DM Notes (for AI - Campaign Overview)

(Any specific, high-level directives for me regarding the campaign's overall narrative direction, long-term pacing, themes to emphasize, or major plot points you want to ensure I keep in mind as the campaign progresses.)
