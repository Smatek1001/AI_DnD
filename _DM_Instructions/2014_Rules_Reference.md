# Vaelin's Campaign - 2014 Official Rules Reference

This document serves as a specific reference for rules from the Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition 2014 ruleset that are relevant to our campaign. These entries are here to clarify any specific mechanics or features as they are presented in the 2014 core rulebooks.

**Note to DM (AI):** Refer to these documented rules as the definitive interpretation for our campaign, unless explicitly overridden by a specific entry in [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules|The House Rules]].

## I. Character Creation & Races

## II. Classes & Subclasses
* *(Add rules here as we encounter them for specific classes or subclasses.)*

## III. Spells

### _Control Flames_
- Transmutation Cantrip
- *Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous or 1 hour (see below)
- You choose a nonmagical flame that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You affect it in one of the following ways:
	- You instantaneously expand the flame 5 feet in one direction, provided that wood or other fuel is present in the new location.
	- You instantaneous ly extinguish the flames within the cube.
	- You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the flame, change its color, or both. The change lasts for 1 hour.
	- You cause simple shapes-such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location- to appear within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 hour.
- If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three non-instantaneous effects created by it active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

## IV. Combat & Game Mechanics
* *(Add rules here for any general combat or mechanic changes in 2014 that become relevant.)*
