# Rule: Warlock Class

## I. Overview & Intent
(Briefly describe what this rule covers and why it's being used or what it changes.)
* **Source/Origin:** 2024 Player's Handbook (pages 153-163)
* **Replaces/Modifies:** This replaces the standard Warlock class from the 2014 Player's Handbook.

## II. Full Rule Text
(Paste or detail the full text of the rule here. Use Markdown formatting, headings, bullet points, and tables as needed to match the original source's structure for clarity.)

### A. [Sub-section, e.g., Class Features]
    * **[Feature Name 1]:** (Details)
    * **[Feature Name 2]:** (Details)

### B. [Sub-section, e.g., Subclasses Available]
    1. **[[Path/To/Subclass_1_Note|Subclass Name 1]]**
        * (Brief overview or link to another detailed note if the subclass itself is extensive)
    2. **[[Path/To/Subclass_2_Note|Subclass Name 2]]**
        * (Brief overview)

## III. Key Differences from Standard 2014 Rules (If Applicable)
(If this is an adopted 2024 rule or a significant modification, highlight the main changes from the 2014 baseline here for quick reference.)
* (Difference 1)
* (Difference 2)

## IV. DM Notes (for AI - How to Interpret/Apply)
(Any specific instructions for me, GemDM, on how to interpret edge cases, prioritize this rule, or integrate it with other existing rules. Also note if any parts of this rule are NOT being adopted.)
* (e.g., "For the Pact of the Blade, ensure it aligns with House Rule X regarding weapon summoning.")
* (e.g., "The 'Mystic Arcanum' feature listed here is adopted as written.")
