### B. General Description

Warlocks quest for knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. They often begin their search for magical power by delving into tomes of forbidden lore, dabbling in invocations meant to attract the power of extra planar beings, or seeking places of power where the influence of these beings can be felt. In no time, each Warlock is drawn into a binding pact with a powerful patron. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as angels, archfey, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, Warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.

Warlocks view their patrons as resources, as means to the end of achieving magical power. Some Warlocks respect, revere, or even love their patrons; some serve their patrons grudgingly; and some seek to undermine their patrons even as they wield the power their patrons have given them.

Once a pact is made, a Warlock's thirst for knowledge and power can't be slaked with mere study. Most Warlocks spend their days pursuing greater power and deeper knowledge, which typically means some kind of adventure.

### C. Becoming a Warlock

#### As a Level 1 Character:
- Gain all the traits in the Core Warlock Traits table.
- Gain the Warlock's level 1 features, which are listed in the Warlock Features table.

#### As a Multiclass Character:
• Gain the following traits from the Core Warlock Traits table: Hit Point Die and training with Light armor.
• Gain the Warlock's level 1 features, which are listed in the Warlock Features table. See the multiclassing rules to determine your available spell slots.

### D. Warlock Class Features

As a Warlock, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Warlock levels. These features are listed in the Warlock Features table.

#### Level 1: Eldritch Invocations
You have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, pieces of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability or other lessons. You gain one invocation of your choice, such as Pact of the Tome. Invocations are described in the "Eldritch Invocation Options" section later in this class's description.
**Prerequisites.** If an invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For example, if an invocation requires you to be a level 5+ Warlock, you can select the invocation once you reach Warlock level 5.
**Replacing and Gaining Invocations.** Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your invocations with another one for which you qualify. You can't replace an invocation if it's a prerequisite for another invocation that you have. When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain more invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations column of the Warlock Features table. You can't pick the same invocation more than once unless its description says otherwise.

#### Level 1: Pact Magic
Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers. The entity is a voice in the shadows-its identity unclear-but its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the Warlock spell list later in the class's description.
*Cantrips* You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice. _Eldritch Blast_ and _Prestidigitation_ are recommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock can trip of your choice.
When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table.

**Spell Slots.** The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1-5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest.
For example, when you're a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell _Witch Bolt_, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells. _Charm_ _Person_ and _Hex_ are recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1-3.
If another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.

#### Level 2: Magical Cunning
You can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute. At the end of it, you regain expended Pact Magic spell slots but no more than a number equal to half your maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 3: Warlock Subclass
You gain a Warlock subclass of your choice. The Archfey Patron, Celestial Patron, Fiend Patron, and Great Old One Patron subclasses are detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Warlock levels. For the rest of your career, you gain eldritch of your subclass's features that are of you Warlock level or lower.

#### Level 4. Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Warlock levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 9 : Contact Patron
In the past, you usually contacted your patron through intermediaries. Now you can communicate directly; you always have the _Contact Other Plane_ spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot to contact your patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell's saving throw. Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can't do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 11: Mystic Arcanum
Your patron grants you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one level 6 Warlock spell as this arcanum. You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in this way again. As shown in the Warlock Features table, you gain another Warlock spell of your choice that can be cast in this way when you reach Warlock levels 13 (level 7 spell), 15 (level 8 spell), and 17 (level 9 spell). You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a Long Rest. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your arcanum spells with another Warlock spell of the same level.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Fate is recommended.

#### Level 20: Eldritch Master
When you use your Magical Cunning feature, you regain all your expended Pact Magic spell slots.

## Warlock Subclasses

A Warlock subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Warlock levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the Archfey Patron, Celestial Patron, Fiend Patron, and Great Old One Patron subclasses.

### Archfey Patron
_Bargain with Whimsical Fey_

Your pact draws on the power of the Feywild. When you choose this subclass, you might make a deal with an archfey, such as the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; or an ancient hag. Or you might call on a spectrum of Fey, weaving a web of favo rs and debts. Whoever they are, your patron is often inscr utable and whimsical.

#### Level 3: Archfey Spells

The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Archfey Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.


| Warlock Level | Spells |
| :---: | :--- |
| 3 | _Calm Emotions_, _Faerie Fire_, _Misty Step_, _Phantasmal Force_, _Sleep_ |
| 5 | _Blink_, _Plant Growth_ |
| 7 | _Dominate Beast_, _Greater Invisibility_ |
| 9 | _Dominate Person_, _Seeming_ |

#### Level 3: Steps of the Fey

Your patron grants you the ability to move between the boundaries of the planes. You can cast _Misty Step_ without expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

In addition, whenever you cast that spell, you can choose one of the following additional effects.

_**Refreshing Step.**_ Immediately after you teleport, you or one creature you can see within 10 feet of yourself gains 1d10 Temporary Hit Points.

_**Taunting Step.**_ Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or have Disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you until the start of your next turn.

#### Level 6: Misty Escape

You can cast _Misty Step_ as a Reaction in response to taking damage. In addition, the following effects are now among your Steps of the Fey options.

_**Disappearing Step.**_ You have the Invisible condition until the start of your next turn or until immediately after you make an attack roll, deal damage, or cast a spell.

_**Dreadful Step.**_ Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left or the space you appear in (your choice) must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d10 Psychic damage.

#### Level 10: Beguling Defenses

Your patron teaches you how to guard your mind and body. You are immune to the Charmed condition.

In addition, immediately after a creature you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to reduce the damage you take by half (round down), and you can force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker takes Psychic damage equal to the damage you take. Once you use this Reaction, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore your use of it.
