# 🌙 **Echo of Corellon**

_Custom Racial Trait – Vaelin Shadowleaf Exclusive_

> _"You were never meant to wear only one face."_

---

## 🎭 **Narrative Origin**

As Vaelin deepens his bond with Caladwen, Archfey of the Whispering Green, he begins to dream of masks, mirrors, and reflections that ripple like water. Guided by the rune-marked pages of _The Faceless Art_ and the glowing tattoo over his heart, he experiences a revelation: elves were never meant to be fixed in form. The rigidity of flesh is a cage born of forgetting.

In Therandril's earliest days, before the Sundering and the Pact, some elves still carried Corellon's fluid essence — a divine echo of shapeshifting grace. Caladwen has awakened that echo in Vaelin, not by bestowing it, but by helping him **remember what he truly is**.

## ✅ **Mechanical Trait: Echo of Corellon**

**Type:** Custom racial trait  
**Source:** Narrative milestone unlocked via connection to Caladwen and study of _The Faceless Art_  
**Availability:** Vaelin Shadowleaf only

---

### **You gain the following ability:**

### **Echo of Corellon**

You have awakened a forgotten elven legacy — the power to reshape your physical form and voice at will.

- As an **action**, you may transform your **physical appearance and voice**. This transformation is **not magical**, and includes:
    - Sex, height, weight, build, facial features, hair, skin tone, eye color, and voice
- You may **assume the appearance of any humanoid you have seen**
- The transformation is **physical** (not an illusion) and **undetectable by magical means**
- It **does not trigger _Detect Magic_, _True Seeing_, or _Dispel Magic_**
- The transformation **lasts until you choose to change again**
- You may use this ability a number of times per long rest equal to your **proficiency bonus** (minimum once)
- You may still cast _Disguise Self_ (via Mask of Many Faces) to **overlay an illusion** atop your real form. In this case, the illusion takes precedence visually.

---

## 🧠 **DM Notes & Implementation**

This trait functions identically to the **Changeling’s Shapechanger** ability but is:

- **Non-magical**, rooted in racial myth and elven divinity
- **Narratively unlocked**, not selected via race or class
- **Compatible with existing magical disguise effects**

If Vaelin is also affected by _Disguise Self_, _Alter Self_, or _Seeming_, those magical disguises **override the visible appearance** granted by _Echo of Corellon_, but the physical change still remains underneath.

This allows for **layered infiltration tactics**, such as:

- Physical disguise using Echo of Corellon
- Illusory overlay using Disguise Self
- Shifting into a stored form to evade magical detection or break pursuit

---

## 🧬 **Optional Future Expansion (DM-Gated)**

As Vaelin levels and continues to uncover forgotten truths, this trait may evolve:

|Tier|Feature|
|---|---|
|**Tier 1 (Unlocked)**|Physical transformation, Prof. Bonus uses per long rest|
|**Tier 2 (Mid-tier unlock)**|Store 1–3 personas, shift into stored forms as bonus action|
|**Tier 3 (High tier)**|Shifting resists truth detection, triggers reaction-based disguise|
|**Tier 4 (Ascension)**|Unlimited shifts, absorb forms of fallen targets, resist divination|

## 🗝️ Flavor Summary (for RP & AI DMs)

> Vaelin’s form flows like memory now. His voice is silk, or gravel, or something you heard in a dream. Whether he’s wearing the face of a servant, a noble, or a ghost from the past — you believe it, because somewhere, part of you **remembers it too**.

---

## 🌿 **Awakening Cutscene: The Whispering Rite**

> _To be played after a mission where Vaelin pushes his identity work to its limit, or completes a key study session with_ The Faceless Art. _Best if done alone, or with one trusted ally nearby._

---

**Setting:**  
Vaelin sits at the edge of an abandoned fountain, deep within Therandril’s ruined upper quarter. His tattoo pulses faintly in the moonlight. The amulet glows. The final lines of _The Faceless Art_ blur as if written in mist.

A breeze passes — but carries no scent, no chill.

A woman stands behind him.

She’s made of leaves.  
No — masks.  
No — smoke that _remembers faces_.

> **Caladwen:**  
> “The book told you what to do. You are not here for guidance. You are here for the key.”

She steps close, placing a finger over the tattoo. Her touch isn’t warm. It’s… **shifting**. Like her body is remembering how to be flesh.

> **Caladwen:**  
> “Your kind once walked between faces like stepping between shadows. But your people forgot. So your flesh forgot. But you, my little ghost of the Green... you _remembered._ And that means you are ready.”

She reaches into her own face and **pulls away a mask** — and underneath is **Vaelin’s own face**, eyes burning with silver-green fire.

> **Caladwen (as Vaelin):**  
> “Take it. It was always yours.”

She presses the mask to your skin.

There is no pain. There is no burning.

There is **unmaking**.

You fall through your memories — past every disguise, every voice you’ve copied, every face you’ve worn. You realize none of them were false.

They were all **you**.

You awaken.  
Different.  
Not wearing a mask.  
You are the mask.

You have unlocked **Echo of Corellon**.
