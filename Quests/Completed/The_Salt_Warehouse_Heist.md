# Quest: The Salt Warehouse Heist

## I. Overview
* **Status:** completed
* **Category:** Heist / Retribution
* **Patron/Quest Giver:** [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf\|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] (self-initiated for revenge for [[Factions/Ratlings\|Ratlings']] stolen medicine)
* **Primary Location:** [[Locations/Salt_Warehouse\|Salt Warehouse]] in the [[Locations/Docks\|Docks]] district.
* **Reward:** 3240 gp
* **Priority:** High (personal objective)

## II. Quest Briefing
Following a tip from [[Characters/NPCs/Finch\|Finch]], [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf\|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] decided to track down [[Characters/NPCs/Magpie_Miri\|Magpie Miri]] and her gang ([[Characters/NPCs/Grol\|Grol]] and [[Characters/NPCs/Pip\|Pip]]) to exact revenge for their earlier theft of the [[Factions/Ratlings\|Ratlings']] medicine box. He located Miri and Grol attempting a new heist at the Salt Warehouse.

## III. Goal & Objectives
* **Main Goal:** Retrieve the loot from [[Characters/NPCs/Magpie_Miri\|Magpie Miri]] and [[Characters/NPCs/Grol\|Grol]] as retribution.
* **Key Objectives/Milestones:**
    * 1. Gather intelligence on Miri's gang's current whereabouts and activities. (Achieved via [[Characters/NPCs/Finch\|Finch]])
    * 2. Locate Miri and Grol at the Salt Warehouse. (Achieved)
    * 3. Outwit and rob Miri and Grol of their current haul. (Achieved via illusionary and physical distractions)
    * 4. Secure the stolen loot. (Achieved)

## IV. Parties Involved
* **Antagonists:**
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Magpie_Miri\|Magpie Miri]] (gang leader, target of retribution)
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Grol\|Grol]] (muscle, target of retribution)
* **Allies/Key NPCs:**
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Finch\|Finch]] (provided intelligence)
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael\|Lirael]] (Vaelin's familiar, invaluable for scouting and assisting with distraction)
* **Relevant Monsters/Threats:** None, as the mission was handled with stealth and deception.

## V. Progress & Current Status
* **Current Stage:** Completed.
* **PC's Knowledge:** Vaelin successfully located Miri and Grol, used an escalating series of disgust-inducing illusions and physical distractions to disorient them, and then silently wheeled away their entire cart of freshly stolen gold. They were last seen fleeing in disarray.
* **Next Steps:** Quest concluded. The acquired gold has been stashed in Vaelin's hideout.

## VI. Potential Complications & Twists
(No major complications arose during this quest execution beyond the inherent risks of stealth and close-quarters manipulation.)

## VII. Resolution & Consequences
* **Success Scenario:** Vaelin successfully exacted retribution on Magpie Miri and Grol, robbing them of their hard-won loot (3240 gp) and driving them off in utter confusion. This completes Vaelin's personal vendetta for the Ratlings' medicine.
* **Failure Scenario:** (Avoided) Had Vaelin failed, Miri and Grol would have escaped with their gold, and Vaelin might have been detected or faced direct confrontation.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
This quest was a direct follow-up to the "Ratlings' Remedy" quest, fulfilling Vaelin's personal objective for revenge. It further demonstrated Vaelin's cunning and reliance on non-lethal, psychological tactics and illusion magic. Miri and Grol's humiliation and loss of their entire haul should have significant consequences for their future operations, potentially making them more desperate or seeking easier targets.
