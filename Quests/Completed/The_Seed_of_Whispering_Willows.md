# Quest: The Seed of Whispering Willows

## I. Overview
* **Status:** completed
* **Category:** side, heist, retrieval
* **Patron/Quest Giver:** [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]] (on behalf of [[Lore/Pantheon/Caladwen|Caladwen]]/Fey Folk)
* **Primary Location:** Elmsworth's Cottage, [[Locations/Beyond_Duskhaven|Beyond Duskhaven]]
* **Reward:** [[Items/Seed_of_Whispering_Willows|Seed of Whispering Willows]], 75 XP, Favor with Lirael/Caladwen

## II. Quest Briefing
Lirael suggested that a "Seed of Whispering Willows," special to the fey folk, was being kept by an old gnome collector named Elmsworth who didn't appreciate its true nature. Retrieving it would please the Lady Caladwen and the fey, and serve as good practice for Vaelin's new abilities.

## III. Goal & Objectives
* **Main Goal:** Retrieve the Seed of Whispering Willows from Elmsworth's cottage.
* **Key Objectives/Milestones:**
    * 1. Travel to Elmsworth's cottage. (Completed)
    * 2. Scout the location. (Completed)
    * 3. Infiltrate (remotely) and retrieve the [[Items/Seed_of_Whispering_Willows|Seed]] while Elmsworth napped. (Completed)
    * 4. Escape undetected. (Completed)

## IV. Parties Involved
* **Antagonists:**
    * Elmsworth (Gnome Collector - unwitting antagonist, possessive of item)
* **Allies/Key NPCs:**
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]] (Scout and guide)
    * [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]

## V. Progress & Current Status
* **Current Stage:** Completed.
* **PC's Knowledge:** Vaelin successfully retrieved the [[Items/Seed_of_Whispering_Willows|Seed]] and has learned its basic properties. He decided to keep it for now.
* **Next Steps:** N/A (Quest Complete)

## VI. Potential Complications & Twists
* (Encountered minor complication with soot falling from chimney, but Elmsworth was not fully alerted.)

## VII. Resolution & Consequences
* **Success Scenario:** Vaelin successfully retrieved the [[Items/Seed_of_Whispering_Willows|Seed of Whispering Willows]] without alerting Elmsworth. He gained the item, XP, and likely favor with his patron/familiar.
* **Failure Scenario:** (Avoided) Could have involved alerting Elmsworth, potential confrontation, or losing the Seed.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
This was a simple side quest designed to allow Vaelin to use his new Warlock abilities (Mage Hand) and interact with his familiar, Lirael. The Seed is a minor magic item fitting his theme.
