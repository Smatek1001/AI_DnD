# Quest: Magpie Miri Harassment Campaign

## I. Overview
* **Status:** completed
* **Category:** espionage, psychological_warfare, indirect_combat
* **Patron/Quest Giver:** [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf\|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] (Self-initiated)
* **Primary Location:** Various locations within [[Locations/Duskhaven\|Duskhaven]], including [[Locations/The_Sinking_Stoat\|The Sinking Stoat]], [[Locations/Abandoned_Warehouse_New_Hideout\|Abandoned Warehouse (New Hideout)]], [[Locations/Market_Square\|Market Square]], [[Locations/Crow's_Nest\|Crow's Nest]], and [[Red_Rooster_Courtyard\|Red Rooster Courtyard]].
* **Reward:** 400 XP
* **Priority:** high (Player-driven)

## II. Quest Briefing
Vaelin Shadowleaf initiated a personal campaign of harassment against **Magpie Miri's gang** (comprising **Miri**, **Grol**, and **Pip**) in retribution for their past actions (specifically, stealing medicine from the Ratlings). The goal was to dismantle their crew and break their morale through indirect, psychological, and covert means, without direct confrontation.

## III. Goal & Objectives
* **Main Goal:** Completely disrupt and neutralize **Magpie Miri's gang**.
* **Key Objectives/Milestones:**
    * 1. Drive the gang from their initial hideout ([[Locations/The_Sinking_Stoat\|The Sinking Stoat]]) through psychological torment. (Completed)
    * 2. Track the gang to their new hideout. (Completed)
    * 3. Observe and infiltrate their new hideout to gather intelligence. (Completed)
    * 4. Inflict further psychological torment and humiliation upon the gang. (Completed)
    * 5. Cause internal strife or external conflict that leads to the gang's collapse. (Completed)
    * 6. Acquire knowledge or items of interest during the campaign. (Completed - Obsidian Orb)

## IV. Parties Involved
* **Antagonists:**
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Magpie_Miri\|Magpie Miri]] (Gang Leader, severely beaten unconscious)
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Grol\|Grol]] (Muscle, severely beaten unconscious)
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Pip\|Pip]] (Lackey, terrified runaway)
    * [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate\|Harbor Syndicate]] (Indirectly involved, inflicted final defeat)
        * [[Characters/NPCs/Skarlix\|Skarlix]] (Loan Shark)
        * [[Characters/NPCs/Brak\|Brak]] (Enforcer)
* **Allies/Key NPCs:**
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael\|Lirael]] (Familiar, provided critical unseen assistance)
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Garrick_Stonehand\|Garrick Stonehand]] (Merchant, warned by Vaelin, indirectly aided in gang's defeat)
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Finch\|Finch]] (Ally, informed of campaign's success)
* **Relevant Monsters/Threats:** None directly, focus on human antagonists.

## V. Progress & Current Status
* **Current Stage:** Completed. The gang is effectively neutralized.
* **PC's Knowledge:** Vaelin successfully disrupted the gang through a series of escalating psychological and indirect physical attacks. He learned of the [[Red_Rooster_Courtyard\|Red Rooster Courtyard]] and acquired the [[Items/Obsidian_Orb\|Obsidian Orb]].
* **Next Steps:** Quest concluded. The repercussions for the defeated gang and the implications of the [[Items/Obsidian_Orb\|Obsidian Orb]] are now new plot hooks.

## VI. Potential Complications & Twists
* The gang's resilience or unexpected allies. (Encountered Garrick's guards and the Syndicate.)
* Accidental detection of Vaelin. (Avoided through high stealth.)
* Unforeseen escalation leading to direct combat. (Managed indirectly.)

## VII. Resolution & Consequences
* **Success Scenario:** **Magpie Miri's gang** has been utterly decimated. **Pip** is a terrified runaway. **Miri** and **Grol** are severely beaten, unconscious, and abandoned in the Docks alley, their pride and plans shattered. The **Harbor Syndicate** now bears a deep grudge against them (believing Miri insulted Skarlix). Vaelin acquired the **Obsidian Orb**, a new mystery.
* **Failure Scenario:** N/A (Quest completed successfully.)

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
This quest served as a long-form demonstration of Vaelin's espionage, illusion, and psychological warfare capabilities. It provided a satisfying narrative arc for a minor antagonist group. The consequences are now open-ended plot hooks: the fate of Miri/Grol, the Syndicate's continued wrath (misdirected at Miri's ghost), and the mystery of the Obsidian Orb.
