# Quest: The Archivist's Appraisal

## I. Overview
* **Status:** completed
* **Category:** delivery, investigation
* **Patron/Quest Giver:** [[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]]
* **Primary Location:** From [[Locations/Shaded_Lantern|Shaded Lantern]] to [[Characters/NPCs/Alistair_Finchley|Alistair Finchley]]'s study in the [[Locations/Docks|Docks]] (Old Salt's Tenements), and back.
* **Reward:** 75 gp, Elaris will cover the cost/procurement of a lead-lined chest for Vaelin, 150 XP.
* **Priority:** medium

## II. Quest Briefing
[[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]] tasked [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] with delivering a small, sealed wooden box containing an ancient elven artifact to Alistair Finchley, a specialist in linguistic esoterica and minor magical item identification. Vaelin was to await Finchley's assessment and return both the artifact and the findings to Elaris with utmost discretion.

## III. Goal & Objectives
* **Main Goal:** Successfully deliver the artifact to [[Characters/NPCs/Alistair_Finchley|Alistair Finchley]], obtain his assessment, and return both to [[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]].
* **Key Objectives/Milestones:**
    * 1. Receive sealed box and instructions from [[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]]. (Completed)
    * 2. Travel to [[Characters/NPCs/Alistair_Finchley|Alistair Finchley]]'s study in the Old Salt's Tenements. (Completed)
    * 3. Deliver the box to [[Characters/NPCs/Alistair_Finchley|Alistair Finchley]]. (Completed)
    * 4. Wait for and receive [[Characters/NPCs/Alistair_Finchley|Alistair Finchley]]'s assessment and the artifact. (Completed)
    * 5. Return to [[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]] and deliver the assessment and artifact. (Completed)

## IV. Parties Involved
* **Antagonists:** None directly encountered for this quest, though the [[Locations/Docks|Docks]] inherently carry risk.
* **Allies/Key NPCs:**
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]] (Quest giver)
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Alistair_Finchley|Alistair Finchley]] (Specialist contact)
* **Relevant Monsters/Threats:** General denizens/dangers of the [[Locations/Docks|Docks]].

## V. Progress & Current Status
* **Current Stage:** Completed.
* **PC's Knowledge:** Vaelin learned that the artifact is a fragment of proto-Seldarine script, possibly a dormant familial protection ward connected to the "House of Silent Stars" and keyed to a bloodline or location.
* **Next Steps:** Quest concluded. [[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]] will research the "House of Silent Stars" and may contact Vaelin if further assistance is needed.

## VI. Potential Complications & Twists
* (None encountered during this quest beyond navigating the Docks discreetly.)

## VII. Resolution & Consequences
* **Success Scenario:** Vaelin successfully completed all objectives, earning his reward and strengthening his professional alliance with [[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]]. The information gained about the artifact may lead to future plot developments.
* **Failure Scenario:** N/A

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
This quest served to introduce [[Characters/NPCs/Alistair_Finchley|Alistair Finchley]], provide Vaelin with XP for leveling, and deepen the mystery surrounding ancient elven lore and potentially [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]]. The "House of Silent Stars" is a new lore element.
