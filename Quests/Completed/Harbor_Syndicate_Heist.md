# Quest: Harbor Syndicate Heist

## I. Overview
* **Status:** completed
* **Category:** Heist, Espionage
* **Patron/Quest Giver:** Personal Gain
* **Primary Location:** [[Locations/Market_Square]] (specifically [[Characters/NPCs/Garrick_Stonehand|Garrick Stonehand's]] shop), leading towards [[Locations/Syndicate_Warehouse]]
* **Reward:** 750 gp
* **Priority:** Medium

## II. Quest Briefing
Vaelin sought a significant sum of liquid wealth (gold coins) to fund his ongoing endeavors. Initial intelligence from [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]] suggested [[Characters/NPCs/Garrick_Stonehand|Garrick Stonehand's]] shop in the [[Locations/Market_Square|Market Square]] as a target, though it was known to be under pressure from the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]].

## III. Goal & Objectives
* **Main Goal:** Acquire a large stash of spendable gold coins.
* **Key Objectives/Milestones:**
    * 1. Gather intelligence on potential high-value targets for a robbery.
    * 2. Scout the chosen target (Garrick Stonehand's shop) for security and current activity.
    * 3. Intercept and acquire the gold from the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]].
    * 4. Escape cleanly with the acquired wealth.

## IV. Parties Involved
* **Antagonists:**
    * [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate]]: The primary criminal organization that collected the gold.
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Skarlix]]: Goblin loan shark involved in the initial debt collection.
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Brak]]: Half-orc enforcer, a key Syndicate thug who fell victim to Vaelin's distraction.
    * Human Syndicate Thugs (2): Enforcers involved in securing the area and transporting the gold.
* **Allies/Key NPCs:**
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Finch]]: Provided crucial initial reconnaissance and intel.
    * [[Factions/Ratlings]]: Finch's gang, providing eyes and ears on the street.
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael]]: Vaelin's familiar, providing aerial reconnaissance and subtle warnings.
* **Relevant Monsters/Threats:** None (humanoid criminal elements).

## V. Progress & Current Status
* **Current Stage:** Completed. The heist was successfully executed.
* **PC's Knowledge:** Vaelin knows the details of how he orchestrated the Syndicate's internal brawl and stole their collection. He also knows the amount of gold acquired and the fact that the Syndicate is now in disarray.
* **Next Steps:** No further steps for this specific quest as it is completed.

## VI. Potential Complications & Twists
* The discovery of heavy [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Syndicate]] presence around [[Characters/NPCs/Garrick_Stonehand|Garrick Stonehand's]] shop.
* The decision to pivot from robbing Garrick directly to robbing the Syndicate *after* their collection.
* The unexpected success of using [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Mage Hand]] to incite a violent internal conflict within the Syndicate crew, creating the perfect distraction.

## VII. Resolution & Consequences
* **Success Scenario:** Vaelin successfully acquired 750 gold pieces from the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate's]] collection, then paid [[Factions/Ratlings|the Ratlings]] their 10% cut (75 gp). The Syndicate was left in a chaotic internal brawl, blaming each other for the loss, without suspecting Vaelin's involvement.
* **Failure Scenario:** If Vaelin had been detected or failed to create a sufficient distraction, he could have faced a direct, dangerous confrontation with multiple Syndicate enforcers, potentially leading to injury, capture, or death, and the loss of the opportunity for gold.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
This quest was a successful side mission that effectively showcased Vaelin's core skills (stealth, deception, arcane cunning). The use of *Mage Hand* to create internal conflict was a standout moment. The immediate consequence is the Syndicate's internal chaos, which will temporarily hinder their operations and distract them from external threats. This also sets up potential future plot hooks where the Syndicate might still try to find the perpetrator or the missing gold, or where their internal power struggles might be exploited by other factions (or Vaelin). The success reinforces Vaelin's relationship with Finch and the Ratlings.
