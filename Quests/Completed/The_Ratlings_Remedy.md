# Quest: The Ratlings' Remedy

## I. Overview
* **Status:** completed
* **Category:** Side Quest / Favor
* **Patron/Quest Giver:** [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]]
* **Primary Location:** [[Locations/Old_Fishery|Old Fishery]] (Cellars), encompassing parts of the [[Locations/Docks|Docks]] district in [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]].
* **Reward:** 75 XP, 1x Crowbar, deepened trust with [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]] and the Ratlings, provision of a secure chest in Vaelin's hideout (managed by Finch) for Ratling valuables.
* **Priority:** High (for the Ratlings' well-being)

## II. Quest Briefing
[[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]] urgently approached [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] in his hideout. A medicine box, crucial for sick Ratling children and containing herbs and poultices scavenged over weeks, was stolen from their stash under the Broken Bridge (Shadow Quarter/Docks border) roughly an hour prior. Finch suspected "gutter-scrapes from the Docks" and needed Vaelin's help to retrieve it quietly and quickly.

## III. Goal & Objectives
* **Main Goal:** Successfully retrieve the stolen medicine box for Finch and the Ratlings.
* **Key Objectives/Milestones:**
    * 1. Gather information on the thieves and their likely whereabouts. (Achieved via Finch, then [[Characters/NPCs/Greta_Mama_Stoneheart|Greta Stoneheart]] & [[Characters/NPCs/Elara_Lark_Stoneheart|Elara "Lark" Stoneheart]] at the [[Locations/Rusty_Anchor|Rusty Anchor]])
    * 2. Locate the thieves and the medicine box. (Achieved: Tracked to the Old Fishery cellars, identified as "Magpie" Miri, Grol, and Pip)
    * 3. Retrieve the medicine box using stealth and cunning. (Achieved via _Minor Illusion_ distraction and infiltration)
    * 4. Return the medicine box to Finch. (Achieved)

## IV. Parties Involved
* **Antagonists:**
    * "Magpie" Miri (human woman with a crow feather in her hair, presumed leader)
    * Grol (large, strong human brute)
    * Pip (twitchy goblin with a shiv)
* **Allies/Key NPCs:**
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]] (quest giver, ally)
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Elara_Lark_Stoneheart|Elara "Lark" Stoneheart]] (provided key intel identifying the thieves)
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Greta_Mama_Stoneheart|Greta "Mama" Stoneheart]] (provided general warning/context)
* **Relevant Monsters/Threats:** The three thieves themselves.

## V. Progress & Current Status
* **Current Stage:** Completed.
* **PC's Knowledge:** Vaelin successfully identified the thieves, tracked them to the cellars of the Old Fishery, used _Minor Illusion_ to distract them, infiltrated their chamber, retrieved the medicine box (and a crowbar), and returned it to Finch. He also offered Finch a secure chest in his hideout for [[Factions/Ratlings|The Ratlings']] valuables, managed by her.
* **Next Steps:** Quest concluded. Vaelin noted the identities of Miri, Grol, and Pip for future reference.

## VI. Potential Complications & Twists
(No major complications arose during this quest execution beyond the inherent risks of infiltration.)

## VII. Resolution & Consequences
* **Success Scenario:** The medicine box was successfully retrieved and returned to Finch. The sick Ratlings will receive their medicine. Vaelin acquired a crowbar. His bond with Finch and the Ratlings was strengthened. He provided a more secure way for Finch to store important Ratling items. The thieves (Miri, Grol, Pip) were outwitted but remain at large.
* **Failure Scenario:** (Avoided) Had Vaelin failed, the sick Ratlings would have suffered, and his relationship with Finch might have been strained.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
This was the first canonical side quest. Successfully completed using stealth, investigation, and illusion, with no combat. Good example of rewarding non-combat solutions. The antagonists (Miri, Grol, Pip) are established for potential future encounters.
