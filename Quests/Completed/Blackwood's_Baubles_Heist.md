# Quest: Blackwood's Baubles Heist

## I. Overview
* **Status:** completed
* **Category:** Heist / Acquisition
* **Patron/Quest Giver:** [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]] (arranged the job, Vaelin owed her 15gp for Ratling services)
* **Primary Location:** [[Locations/Blackwood's_Baubles|Blackwood's Baubles]], a jeweler and specialty goods shop in [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]].
* **Reward:** 300 XP; approx. 18-19gp net cash for Vaelin after repaying Finch with a bonus; numerous acquired items including the "Occulus Array" (Clockwork Lenses), "Resonance Core" (Sealed Lacquer Cylinder), Dried Dark Herbs, Obsidian Gemstone, three magical Vials, a mysterious Parchment, an Illusion Hand-Mirror, a Transmutation Locket, a Deck of Divination Cards, a Jeweler's Loupe, and some minor customer repair items. Increased trust with Finch.
* **Priority:** High (initially, due to Finch's request and need for funds).

## II. Quest Briefing
[[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]] informed [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]] of a lucrative but risky opportunity: to heist valuable "specialty goods" from Silas Blackwood, a jeweler known to deal in unusual items. Finch fronted 15gp for Ratling surveillance, which Vaelin was to repay from the heist's proceeds. The primary targets were a warded wooden box believed to contain these specialty goods, and any other valuables Vaelin could acquire, especially cash. Lirael performed initial scouting.

## III. Goal & Objectives
* **Main Goal:** Successfully infiltrate [[Locations/Blackwood's_Baubles|Blackwood's Baubles]] and acquire valuable goods, including the "specialty goods" and enough to repay Finch.
* **Key Objectives/Milestones:**
    * 1. Plan the infiltration with [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]]. (Achieved)
    * 2. Infiltrate [[Locations/Blackwood's_Baubles|Blackwood's Baubles]] workshop via the back window. (Achieved)
    * 3. Retrieve the contents of the warded wooden box (the "specialty goods": Occulus Array, Resonance Core, Dark Herbs). (Achieved)
    * 4. Acquire additional valuables/cash. (Achieved: Approx. 38-39gp cash, various magical/mundane items from study strongbox and front showroom drawers/till).
    * 5. Exfiltrate the shop without raising a general alarm. (Achieved)
    * 6. Decipher any acquired intelligence. (Achieved: Read parchment from Magister Vayne).
    * 7. Secure funds to repay [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]]. (Achieved: 20gp set aside).

## IV. Parties Involved
* **Antagonists (Unaware/Avoided):**
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Silas_Blackwood|Silas Blackwood]] (Shop Owner)
    * Blackwood's Inside Guard (Hexed and slept through most of it)
    * Blackwood's Outside Guard (Patrolling, unaware)
* **Allies/Key NPCs:**
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]] (Quest contact)
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]] (Familiar, provided crucial scouting and support)
* **Mentioned/Indirectly Involved:**
    * "Magister Vayne" (Author of the parchment)
    * "Old Woman" (Sold Divination cards to Blackwood, seen in Lirael's recalled scouting)

## V. Progress & Current Status
* **Current Stage:** Completed. Vaelin successfully executed the heist, acquired significant loot and intelligence, and returned to his hideout. He has set aside funds for Finch.
* **PC's Knowledge:** Vaelin knows the contents of the warded box, the iron strongbox, and other drawers. He has read the parchment from Magister Vayne.
* **Next Steps:** Deliver payment to Finch; investigate the nature and purpose of the acquired magical items (especially the Occulus Array, Resonance Core, Vials, Deck of Cards) and the implications of Magister Vayne's letter.

## VI. Potential Complications & Twists
* The inside guard was nearly woken multiple times but Vaelin's stealth and the Hex spell prevented full alert.
* The discovery that the warded wooden box had (likely new) external Abjuration wards, and the iron strongbox was well-locked.
* The contents of the warded box and the parchment hint at a larger, more complex situation involving "Magister Vayne," the "Occulus Array," "Resonance Core," "Therandran Protocol," and the "Night of Whispers."

## VII. Resolution & Consequences
* **Success Scenario:** Vaelin successfully acquired valuable items and crucial intelligence. He secured enough funds to repay Finch with a bonus. Blackwood remains unaware of the full extent of the theft for now.
* **Future Consequences:** Blackwood will eventually discover the theft. Magister Vayne's plans may be impacted or Vaelin may become a target if his involvement is discovered. The acquired items, especially the Array, Core, and Parchment, are likely to lead to new quests or dangers.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
This quest served as a successful stealth-focused heist, allowing Vaelin to utilize a range of his skills. The loot acquired, particularly the parchment and the unique magical items, are intended to be significant plot hooks for future adventures and to tie into the campaign's deeper mysteries. The player's ability to adapt plans and use resources like Lirael effectively was key.
