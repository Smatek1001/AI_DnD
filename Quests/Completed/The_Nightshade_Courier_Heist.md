# Quest: The Nightshade Courier Heist

## I. Overview
* **Status:** completed
* **Category:** Heist / Espionage
* **Patron/Quest Giver:** [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]] (provided the initial tip)
* **Primary Location:** [[Locations/Whispering_Door|Whispering Door]] and its associated hidden passages in the [[Locations/Veil|Veil]] District.
* **Reward:** 2440 gp
* **Priority:** Medium (self-initiated for profit)

## II. Quest Briefing
[[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]] provided [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] with a tip about a high-value gold transfer being conducted by the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]] through a new, discreet courier route in the [[Locations/Veil|Veil]] district. The gold was described as "purer" than usual, and the courier as a "ghost." The transfer was scheduled for "tonight."

## III. Goal & Objectives
* **Main Goal:** Intercept the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]'s gold transfer.
* **Key Objectives/Milestones:**
    * 1. Infiltrate the [[Locations/Whispering_Door|Whispering Door]] and observe Guild activity. (Achieved)
    * 2. Identify the courier and their intended route. (Achieved: [[Characters/NPCs/Mira_Quickfingers|Mira "Quickfingers"]] was the courier, using hidden magical passages from the tavern)
    * 3. Intercept the courier and acquire the gold using stealth and subterfuge. (Achieved via [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]]'s distraction and Mage Hand)
    * 4. Escape with the gold undetected. (Achieved)

## IV. Parties Involved
* **Antagonists:**
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Mira_Quickfingers|Mira "Quickfingers"]] (halfling fence, the courier)
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Vrenna|Vrenna]] (drow elder, overseeing the transfer at the tavern)
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Jib|Jib]] (halfling lookout at the tavern)
    * The [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]] (the target faction)
* **Allies/Key NPCs:**
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]] (provided the initial intelligence)
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]] (Vaelin's familiar, invaluable for scouting and distraction)
* **Relevant Monsters/Threats:** None, as the mission was handled with stealth and deception.

## V. Progress & Current Status
* **Current Stage:** Completed.
* **PC's Knowledge:** Vaelin successfully infiltrated the Whispering Door, identified Mira as the courier, tracked her through magically concealed passages with Lirael's aid, and executed a flawless snatch of the gold. He witnessed Mira's subsequent panic and her apparent dismissal by Vrenna.
* **Next Steps:** Quest concluded. The acquired gold has been stashed in Vaelin's hideout.

## VI. Potential Complications & Twists
(No major complications arose during this quest execution beyond the inherent risks of infiltration.)

## VII. Resolution & Consequences
* **Success Scenario:** The gold was successfully acquired (2440 gp). Vaelin gained significant wealth without direct confrontation. The Nightshade Guild suffered a loss and their courier, Mira, is now disgraced.
* **Failure Scenario:** (Avoided) Had Vaelin failed, the Nightshade Guild would have completed their transfer, and Vaelin might have been detected or faced direct confrontation.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
This quest successfully leveraged Vaelin's stealth, magic (Mage Hand, Disguise Self), and familiar abilities (Lirael's Misty Step, Fey Sight, Mimicry). It provided a significant gold reward and further established the internal workings and ruthless nature of the Nightshade Guild. Mira "Quickfingers" is now a disgraced NPC who might seek revenge or a new path. The presence of magically hidden passages is a key lore element for the Veil district.
