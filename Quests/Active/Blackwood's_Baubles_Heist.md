# Quest: Blackwood's Baubles Heist

## I. Overview
* **Status:** active
* **Category:** side (heist)
* **Patron/Quest Giver:** [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]] (on behalf of the Ratlings)
* **Primary Location:** Blackwood's Baubles, a shop on the border of the [[Locations/Shadow_Quarter|Shadow Quarter]] and the Docks district of [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]].
* **Reward:** Recovery of 15gp owed to the Ratlings (to be given to Finch). [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]] keeps any additional monetary loot and the "specialty goods" from the strongbox. Experience Points.
* **Priority:** medium

## II. Quest Briefing
[[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]], leader of the Ratlings, has tasked [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]] with infiltrating the shop of Silas Blackwood, a miserly merchant. Blackwood owes the Ratlings 15gp. He is also rumored to have recently acquired some "specialty goods" kept in a strongbox in his back room. The shop is guarded by two seemingly inept thugs.

## III. Goal & Objectives
* **Main Goal:** Infiltrate Blackwood's Baubles at night, bypass security, open the strongbox, retrieve the 15gp for Finch, and secure any other valuables (especially the "specialty goods") for Vaelin.
* **Key Objectives/Milestones:**
    * 1. Receive update from Finch's Ratlings on guard patterns (Pending - Evening of Day 5).
    * 2. Infiltrate Blackwood's Baubles at night (Pending).
    * 3. Neutralize or bypass the two guards (Pending).
    * 4. Locate and access the back room strongbox (Location known).
    * 5. Check for and disarm any traps on the strongbox (Potential trap hinted by Finch).
    * 6. Open the strongbox and secure its contents (Contents: multiple faint magical auras detected).
    * 7. Optionally investigate the warded (Abjuration) box in the upstairs living quarters (Location known).
    * 8. Exfiltrate safely with the loot.
    * 9. Deliver 15gp to Finch.

## IV. Parties Involved
* **Antagonists:**
    * Silas Blackwood (Shop proprietor, likely to be asleep).
    * Two hired thugs (guards at the front of the shop).
* **Allies/Key NPCs:**
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]] & the Ratlings (providing intel).
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]] (assisting Vaelin).
* **Relevant Monsters/Threats:**
    * Potential simple trap on the strongbox.

## V. Progress & Current Status
* **Current Stage:** Reconnaissance phase completed by Vaelin and Lirael. Ratling surveillance of guards is ongoing. Awaiting nightfall and Finch's update to proceed with infiltration.
* **PC's Knowledge:** Vaelin has detailed knowledge of the shop's exterior, front shop layout, back room (including strongbox location and its magical contents), and upstairs living quarters (including warded box). He knows about the two guards and their general daytime behavior. Finch has provided general intel about Blackwood and the guards' likely night-time laxity.
* **Next Steps:**
    * Receive intel update from Finch after dusk.
    * Finalize plan and execute the heist "deep in the night."

## VI. Potential Complications & Twists
* Guards may be more alert or numerous than anticipated at night.
* Blackwood may be a lighter sleeper or have unexpected personal defenses.
* The strongbox trap could be more complex than "simple."
* The "specialty goods" might be dangerous, cursed, or draw unwanted attention.
* The warded box upstairs could contain something unexpected or problematic.
* City Watch patrol, though unlikely, could pass at an inopportune moment.

## VII. Resolution & Consequences
* **Success Scenario:** Vaelin acquires loot, XP, and the 15gp for Finch. His reputation with Finch and the Ratlings is strengthened. The nature of the "specialty goods" is discovered.
* **Failure Scenario:** Vaelin is detected, captured, or forced to flee empty-handed. Blackwood might increase security. Relationship with Finch could be strained if her 15gp isn't recovered.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
* This is intended as a relatively "basic heist" for Vaelin to gain XP and test his skills.
* Emphasize stealth and clever problem-solving.
* The contents of the strongbox and the warded box upstairs should be determined when Vaelin accesses them. The "specialty goods" should be interesting â€“ perhaps a collection of minor magical trinkets, rare arcane components, or a single more unusual (but not overly powerful) item.
