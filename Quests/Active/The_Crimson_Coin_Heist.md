# Quest: The Crimson Coin Heist

## I. Overview
* **Status:** active
* **Category:** Heist
* **Patron/Quest Giver:** [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] (Self-Motivated)
* **Primary Location:** [[Locations/The_Crimson_Coin|The Crimson Coin]] gambling den in the [[Locations/Veil|Veil]] district of [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]].
* **Reward:** Substantial gold (anticipated 1000-3000 gp), rare illicit contacts.
* **Priority:** high

## II. Quest Briefing
Vaelin needs a significant influx of gold. "The Crimson Coin," a high-stakes gambling den owned by Sterling Vane, is known for its constant flow of illicit wealth from Duskhaven's elite and underworld. This offers a direct path to a substantial payday.

## III. Goal & Objectives
* **Main Goal:** Infiltrate "The Crimson Coin" and steal a significant sum of gold from its counting room or vault.
* **Key Objectives/Milestones:**
    * 1. Gain entry to the exclusive gambling den, possibly through social engineering or stealth.
    * 2. Gather intelligence on "The Crimson Coin"'s layout, security measures (guards, locks, wards), and the location of the main vault/cash reserves.
    * 3. Bypass the den's security and extract the gold without raising an alarm or leaving a trace.
    * 4. Escape cleanly with the loot.

## IV. Parties Involved
* **Antagonists:**
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Sterling_Vane|Sterling Vane]]: The cunning and observant proprietor.
    * Gambling den staff (pit bosses, dealers, silent enforcers, bouncers).
    * Security measures (intricate locks, possibly arcane wards, hidden alarms).
* **Allies/Key NPCs:**
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]]: Can assist with scouting, distractions, or bypassing smaller obstacles.
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]]: Can be leveraged for street-level intelligence on the den's access points or typical patron movements.
    * Other underworld contacts for fence, if needed later.
* **Relevant Monsters/Threats:** None, primarily human opposition and security systems.

## V. Progress & Current Status
* **Current Stage:** New mission identified; initial planning phase.
* **PC's Knowledge:** Knows the general reputation of "The Crimson Coin" and its owner, Sterling Vane, as a place of wealth exchange.
* **Next Steps:** Begin reconnaissance on "The Crimson Coin."

## VI. Potential Complications & Twists
* Sterling Vane might have unexpected, high-level connections to city authorities or a powerful faction.
* The vault might contain something other than gold, or a cursed/trapped item.
* A major faction dispute could spill into the gambling den during the heist.
* The amount of gold might be significantly less or more than anticipated, altering the risk/reward.

## VII. Resolution & Consequences
* **Success Scenario:** Vaelin acquires a large sum of gold, significantly boosting his finances and potentially gaining a reputation as a master thief.
* **Failure Scenario:** Vaelin is caught, potentially leading to capture, torture for information, or a bounty on his head from a powerful, neutral criminal.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
This heist should emphasize Vaelin's social skills (Deception, Persuasion for entry/observation), Perception and Investigation for security, and Thieves' Tools/magic for infiltration. Combat should be avoidable if Vaelin plays it smart. Sterling Vane should be a memorable, non-combat antagonist who might even try to "negotiate" or play games if Vaelin is discovered. The ambiance should be high-stakes, tense, and luxurious but with a dark undercurrent.
