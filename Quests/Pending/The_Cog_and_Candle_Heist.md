# Quest: The Cog and Candle Heist

## I. Overview
* **Status:** pending
* **Category:** Heist
* **Patron/Quest Giver:** [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] (Self-Motivated)
* **Primary Location:** [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]], a shadowed alley between the [[Locations/Market_Square|Market Square]] and the [[Locations/Veil|Veil]] districts.
* **Reward:** Antique automaton or potent arcane components.
* **Priority:** medium

## II. Quest Briefing
Vaelin has identified "The Cog & Candle," an Arcane Curios & Clockwork Emporium owned by the paranoid gnome, Grizzel Cogsworth, as a target. Rumors suggest Grizzel has recently acquired a valuable antique automaton or a collection of highly potent arcane components. This heist is about acquiring these items for profit or arcane research.

## III. Goal & Objectives
* **Main Goal:** Infiltrate "The Cog & Candle" and acquire either the antique automaton or the potent arcane components.
* **Key Objectives/Milestones:**
    * 1. Gather intelligence on Grizzel Cogsworth's routines and the shop's security measures.
    * 2. Bypass or disable Grizzel's custom-built mechanical and arcane traps.
    * 3. Locate and extract the target item(s) from the shop.

## IV. Parties Involved
* **Antagonists:**
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Grizzel_Cogsworth|Grizzel Cogsworth]]: The paranoid, reclusive gnome proprietor.
    * Shop security (mechanical traps, arcane wards, potentially hired guards).
* **Allies/Key NPCs:**
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]]: Can assist with scouting and bypassing smaller traps.
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]]: Can provide street-level intelligence on Grizzel's movements or local rumors.
* **Relevant Monsters/Threats:** None specified, but Grizzel's automatons might be active.

## V. Progress & Current Status
* **Current Stage:** Idea conceived; no action taken yet.
* **PC's Knowledge:** Knows the shop's name, owner, and rumored valuable items.
* **Next Steps:** Planning and reconnaissance.

## VI. Potential Complications & Twists
* The automaton might be sentient or cursed.
* The arcane components could be unstable or guarded by a magical entity.
* Grizzel Cogsworth might have unexpected connections to a major faction.
* The shop's security could be far more advanced than anticipated.

## VII. Resolution & Consequences
* **Success Scenario:** Vaelin acquires the valuable item(s), gains significant gold or a powerful arcane asset, and possibly new lore related to arcane engineering.
* **Failure Scenario:** Vaelin is caught, Grizzel alerts authorities or a powerful faction, leading to pursuit or a damaged reputation.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Emphasize the intricate, potentially unique nature of Grizzel's traps. This heist should be a puzzle for Vaelin's Dexterity (Sleight of Hand, Stealth, Acrobatics for traps), Intelligence (Investigation for mechanisms/wards), and Warlock spells like Detect Magic, Mage Hand. Grizzel should be quirky but dangerous. The value of the stolen item should reflect the difficulty.
