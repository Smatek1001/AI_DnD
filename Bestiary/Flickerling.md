## IV. Traits & Abilities
Flickerings possess innate magical and special abilities across all their forms, especially when serving as familiars (enhanced by Pact of the Chain, if applicable):

* **Standard Familiar Characteristics:** As familiars summoned via _Find Familiar_ (enhanced by [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Warlock_Class_2024#E. Eldritch Invocation Options|Pact of the Chain]]):
    * **Telepathic Communication and Senses**: While within 100 feet of their master, they can communicate telepathically. As an action, their master can see through their eyes and hear what they hear until the start of their next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses they have.
    * **Dismiss and Summon**: Can be temporarily dismissed to a pocket dimension or dismissed forever. Can reappear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of their master as an action.
    * **Spell Delivery**: Can deliver touch spells cast by their master.
    * **[[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Warlock_Class_2024#E. Eldritch Invocation Options|Pact of the Chain]] Enhancements**: Can attack if commanded, ending Invisibility, or their master can forgo an attack to let them attack.

## V. Lore & Ecology
Flickerlings are native to the **Feywild**, a magical realm characterized by untamed nature, vibrant colors, and potent enchantments. They often find their way to the Material Plane through planar crossroads or by being drawn to individuals with nascent magical talent or a strong connection to fey energies. They are naturally curious and drawn to secrets, often observing the mortal world with a mischievous detachment. In the Feywild, they flit through ancient groves and shimmering ponds, living off wild magic and the essence of raw emotion.

## VI. Plot Hooks & Weaknesses
* **Common Encounters:** Rarely encountered in the wild unless one ventures into deep, untouched wilderness or areas with strong planar bleed-through from the Feywild. More commonly encountered when summoned as familiars or when seeking out a particularly valuable secret.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** A Flickerling might lead a PC to a hidden fey crossing; its natural curiosity could inadvertently reveal a hidden secret or danger; a fey creature might seek to reclaim a lost Flickerling.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** While magically resistant, strong iron or cold iron weapons might bypass some of their defenses (DM discretion). Their mischievous nature can sometimes be exploited.

## VII. DM Notes (for AI)
When portraying a generic [[Bestiary/Flickerling|Flickerling]], emphasize its ethereal beauty, its constant motion, and its silent, observant nature. Their presence should feel magical and slightly alien, contrasting with the grimdark setting of [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]. Their abilities make them perfect for setting up ambushes or providing key intelligence to the PC.
