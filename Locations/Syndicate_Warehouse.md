# Syndicate Warehouse

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Hideout
* **Parent Location:** [[Docks]]
* **Status:** active
* **Population:** Moderate (Harbor Syndicate members, hired muscle)
* **Atmosphere/Vibe:** A fortified, utilitarian space heavy with the scent of salt, canvas, and a subtle metallic tang. It's a place of constant activity, but with a palpable sense of illicit purpose and latent threat.
* **Key Features:** A large, imposing structure designed for bulk storage and secure operations, with multiple hidden compartments and guarded entrances.

## II. Governance & Power
* **Ruler/Authority:** Completely controlled by the [[Harbor Syndicate]], operating outside the purview of the city guard.
* **Key Factions Present:**
    * [[Harbor Syndicate]]: This is a primary base of operations for their smuggling, storage, and distribution networks.
* **Laws & Customs:** The Syndicate's word is law. Intruders are met with lethal force. Discretion and loyalty are paramount.

## III. Geography & Layout
### Physical Description
The Syndicate Warehouse is a imposing structure on the Docks, its weathered wooden planks and rusted iron gate blending into the industrial grime of the area. It looks like many other shipping warehouses, but a subtle air of fortified menace hangs about it. Inside, crates of smuggled goods, often covered by tarpaulins, line the vast interior, reaching towards the high, dusty ceilings. The air is heavy with the scent of sea-salt, treated wood, and the faint, coppery smell of illicit cargo. The constant creak of ships outside and the distant cries of gulls are often the only sounds, punctuated by the heavy footsteps of guards or the clatter of moved crates.
### Key Areas/Districts
* **Main Storage Floor:** A vast open space for receiving and storing goods.
* **Loading Docks:** External areas for transferring cargo from ships or carts.
* **Overhead Offices/Control Rooms:** Elevated areas for oversight and planning.
* **Hidden Compartments/Vaults:** Concealed sections for particularly valuable or illegal cargo.

## IV. Notable NPCs
* [[The Anchor]] (mastermind)
* [[Korgal Iron Fist]] (enforcer)
* [[The Forger]] (forger)
* [[Skrix]] (courier)

## V. Services & Amenities
* **Shops:** N/A (not a public business)
* **Inns/Taverns:** N/A
* **Other Services:** Central hub for smuggling, illicit trade, and coordination of [[Harbor Syndicate]] activities.

## VI. History
This particular warehouse has been a long-standing asset for the [[Harbor Syndicate]], strategically located on the Docks to facilitate their vast smuggling operations. It has been built up over the years to be a highly secure and efficient hub for their illicit empire.

## VII. Current Events & Plot Hooks
* **Ongoing Conflicts:** A frequent target for rival gangs (like the [[Nightshade Guild]]) seeking to disrupt the Syndicate's flow of goods.
* **Rumors & Secrets:** Whispers of a particularly valuable or dangerous shipment due to arrive or currently being stored; rumors of internal power struggles within the Syndicate affecting its operations.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Vaelin might be tasked with infiltrating the warehouse to steal a specific item or intel; he could be hired to sabotage a shipment; or he might need to extract a captive held within its walls. This location was targeted in Vaelin's non-canonical _The Gilded Sting_, and is a potential future target with the current Guild-Syndicate tension.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Emphasize the heavy security and the sheer volume of illicit goods. Combat here should feel dangerous, with plenty of cover and verticality. The atmosphere should be one of constant, low-level threat.
