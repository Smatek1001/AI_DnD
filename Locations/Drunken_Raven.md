# Drunken Raven

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Tavern
* **Parent Location:** [[Locations/Shadow_Quarter]]
* **Status:** active
* **Population:** Moderate (mix of locals and covert operatives)
* **Atmosphere/Vibe:** Dim, smoky, and deceptively ordinary. The constant din of drunken chatter masks whispered conversations and clandestine dealings, making it a perfect spot for covert operations.
* **Key Features:** A seemingly run-down tavern that functions as a secure meeting point for [[Factions/The_Society]].

## II. Governance & Power
* **Ruler/Authority:** While ostensibly under the city's authority, the Drunken Raven maintains a strict neutrality enforced by its bouncer, making it safe for various underworld elements, especially [[Factions/The_Society]] operatives.
* **Key Factions Present:**
    * [[Factions/The_Society]]: This tavern serves as a key base of operations and a primary meeting point for its agents, particularly for [[Characters/NPCs/Talia_Whisper|Talia "Whisper"]].
* **Laws & Customs:** "Mind your own business" is the unspoken rule. Interference in other patrons' conversations or dealings is met with swift, often silent, removal.

## III. Geography & Layout
### Physical Description
The [[Locations/Drunken_Raven|Drunken Raven]] is marked by its faded sign—a tipsy raven clutching a tankard—that groans faintly in the wind above a perpetually creaky door. Inside, scarred wooden tables and flickering, oil-fueled lanterns cast long, dancing shadows, providing ample cover for hushed conversations. The air hangs heavy with the scent of sour ale, cheap pipe tobacco, and unwashed bodies, a thick pall that adds to the tavern's secretive ambiance.
### Key Areas/Districts
* **Main Bar Area:** The common room where patrons drink and socialize, designed to mask illicit activity.
* **Secluded Booths:** Dark, out-of-the-way booths ideal for private meetings.
* **Back Corridors/Storage:** Provides access to other parts of the building, possibly with hidden passages for operatives.

## IV. Notable NPCs
* [[Characters/NPCs/Talia_Whisper|Talia "Whisper"]] (Society operative)
* [[Characters/NPCs/Tarren|Tarren]] (bouncer)

## V. Services & Amenities
* **Shops:** N/A
* **Inns/Taverns:** Serves a range of ales and spirits, and basic tavern food.
* **Other Services:** A reliable, neutral meeting ground for information exchange and mission coordination, particularly for [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]].

## VI. History
The Drunken Raven has long been a fixture of the [[Locations/Shadow_Quarter|Shadow Quarter]], but its true significance emerged with the establishment of [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]] as a major clandestine force in [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]. Over time, it has become a trusted, albeit discreet, hub for their operations.

## VII. Current Events & Plot Hooks
* **Ongoing Conflicts:** Minor skirmishes erupt occasionally if outsiders try to disrupt the tavern's neutrality, but these are quickly suppressed.
* **Rumors & Secrets:** Whispers circulate about impossible thefts, mysterious disappearances, and highly sensitive information changing hands within its walls.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** [[Characters/NPCs/Talia_Whisper|Talia "Whisper"]] might have a new mission for [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]; the PC could overhear a crucial conversation; the tavern might be targeted by a rival faction attempting to uncover [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]] secrets.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Emphasize the sound masking – the general noise of the tavern should make it difficult to discern specific conversations unless actively trying. [[Characters/NPCs/Tarren|Tarren]]'s presence should feel like a constant, unblinking deterrent to overt trouble. The sense of secrets being exchanged should be palpable.
