# Starfall Manor

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Society Base
* **Parent Location:** [[High District]]
* **Status:** active
* **Population:** Sparse (primarily high-ranking Society members and trusted staff)
* **Atmosphere/Vibe:** An elegant facade masking a deeply secretive and influential hub. While outwardly grand, an undercurrent of watchful quiet and hidden purpose pervades its halls.
* **Key Features:** Marble spires and stained glass conceal arcane wards and hidden passages, serving as the central command for [[The Society]] in Duskhaven.

## II. Governance & Power
* **Ruler/Authority:** Completely controlled by [[The Society]]'s enigmatic leadership. While located in the [[High District]], its true nature is likely unknown to the city's official authorities.
* **Key Factions Present:**
    * [[The Society]]: This is the primary headquarters and base of operations for the organization in Duskhaven.
* **Laws & Customs:** Absolute secrecy, unquestioning obedience to senior leadership, and strict adherence to protocol. Intrusion is met with immediate, silent neutralization.

## III. Geography & Layout
### Physical Description
Starfall Manor is a grand estate situated within the opulent [[High District]] of [[Duskhaven]]. Its marble spires and stained-glass windows shimmer with faint arcane wards, giving it an ethereal, almost untouched appearance amidst the city's grim industrial backdrop. Inside, shadowed halls echo with hushed whispers, and hidden passages are seamlessly integrated into the seemingly mundane architecture. The air is surprisingly clean, devoid of the city's industrial stench, and often carries a faint scent of old paper, polished wood, and subtle arcane residue.
### Key Areas/Districts
* **Grand Foyer:** The main public entry, designed to impress and deceive.
* **Meeting Chambers:** Secure rooms where Society elders conduct sensitive discussions.
* **Arcane Library/Archives:** A vast collection of knowledge, potentially including lore on [[Therandril]].
* **Training Facilities:** Hidden areas for honing operative skills.
* **Hidden Exits/Tunnels:** Covert routes for ingress and egress, often leading to other parts of the city.

## IV. Notable NPCs
* [[Elyndra]] (Society elder)

## V. Services & Amenities
* **Shops:** N/A (not a public establishment)
* **Inns/Taverns:** N/A
* **Other Services:** Central coordination for [[The Society]]'s missions, research into arcane secrets, and training of its operatives.

## VI. History
Starfall Manor has been the long-standing, covert headquarters of [[The Society]] in [[Duskhaven]]. Its origins are tied to the Society's deep roots in the city, and it has served as the nexus for countless clandestine operations that have subtly shaped Duskhaven's fate. Its very existence is a testament to the Society's power and secrecy.

## VII. Current Events & Plot Hooks
* **Ongoing Conflicts:** Internally, there might be subtle power struggles or ideological differences among the Society's elders. Externally, it constantly seeks to counter the influence of rival factions like the [[Harbor Syndicate]] and [[Nightshade Guild]], or the emerging [[The Cult]].
* **Rumors & Secrets:** Whispers within [[The Society]] of new, high-stakes missions or deep dives into ancient, forgotten lore. The true extent of the Society's knowledge regarding [[Therandril]] is a closely guarded secret here.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** [[Elyndra]] might assign Vaelin a high-level, sensitive mission originating from the Manor; Vaelin could seek access to its arcane library for information on his past or [[Therandril]]; the Manor itself might come under threat from an external force, requiring Vaelin to defend it. Elyndra’s Therandril knowledge could unlock Vaelin’s tattoo; Society missions may draw Vaelin here.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Portray Starfall Manor as outwardly grand but inwardly labyrinthine and cold. The atmosphere should be one of deep secrets and quiet power. Every interaction should feel like it has layers of hidden meaning. The NPCs here are highly intelligent and discreet.
