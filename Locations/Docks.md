# Docks

*(This content is synthesized from existing campaign notes.)*

## I. Overview
* **Category:** District
* **Parent Location:** [[Locations/Duskhaven]]
* **Status:** active
* **Population:** Dense and varied, a melting pot of honest laborers (sailors, dockworkers, merchants) and a significant criminal underworld presence (smugglers, thugs, fences).
* **Atmosphere/Vibe:** A bustling, grimy, and weather-beaten port district, alive with the cacophony of maritime commerce and shadowed by illicit dealings. The air is thick with the smells of brine, fish, damp wood, coal smoke, industrial effluence, and stale ale. An undercurrent of tension and danger pervades, especially after dark.
* **Key Features:** Towering cargo cranes (possibly steam-powered), numerous weathered wooden piers and wharves, imposing warehouses, docked ships of various sizes, and a network of narrow, refuse-strewn alleyways. The constant sounds include creaking ships, distant steam whistles, gulls, and the rumble of machinery.

## II. Governance & Power
* **Ruler/Authority:** Nominally under the jurisdiction of [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]'s City Watch, but their presence is minimal and often corrupt. The [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate]] exercises de facto control over most of the [[Locations/Docks|Docks]], particularly its illicit economies.
* **Key Factions Present:**
    * [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate]]: Dominant force, controlling smuggling, extortion, and much of the warehousing.
    * [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild]]: Operatives and fences are active, particularly around neutral grounds like the [[Locations/Rusty_Anchor]], often clashing with Syndicate interests.
* **Laws & Customs:** [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]]'s word is often law in the shadows. "Look the other way" is a common survival tactic. Disputes are often settled violently and outside official channels.

## III. Geography & Layout
### Physical Description
[[Locations/Docks|The Docks]] are a sprawling, chaotic expanse of salt-crusted timber and grimy stone, constantly exposed to the harsh sea winds and the city's industrial smog. Weather-beaten warehouses with rusted iron gates line cobbled streets slick with grime and an oily sheen on the water of the harbor. Rickety piers jut out into the murky water, often crowded with moored vessels ranging from small fishing skiffs to larger merchant cogs. Fog frequently rolls in from the sea, further obscuring visibility.
### Key Areas/Districts
* **Main Wharves & Piers:** Areas of constant loading and unloading of cargo, legal and illegal.
* **Warehouse District:** A maze of large storage buildings, many controlled by the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]].
    * [[Locations/Syndicate_Warehouse|Syndicate Warehouse]]: A primary operations hub for the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]].
* **Tavern Row / Entertainment Area (Rough):** A collection of dive bars and establishments catering to sailors and dockworkers.
    * [[Locations/Crow's_Nest|Crow's Nest]]: A cramped tavern used by the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]] for loan sharking.
    * [[Locations/Rusty_Anchor|Rusty Anchor]]: A neutral-ground tavern known for its hard-won peace.
* **Fish Markets:** Open-air markets selling the daily catch, often reeking strongly.
* **Shipwrights & Repair Yards:** Areas dedicated to the construction and maintenance of vessels.

## IV. Notable NPCs
(NPCs frequently found or operating primarily within the Docks district)
* [[Characters/NPCs/The_Anchor|The Anchor]] (Mastermind of the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]], operates from [[Locations/Syndicate_Warehouse|Syndicate Warehouse]])
* [[Characters/NPCs/Korgal_Iron_Fist|Korgal Iron Fist]] (Harbor Syndicate Enforcer, based at [[Locations/Syndicate_Warehouse|Syndicate Warehouse]])
* [[Characters/NPCs/The_Forger|The Forger]] (Harbor Syndicate Forger, hidden workshop in Docks)
* [[Characters/NPCs/Skrix|Skrix]] (Harbor Syndicate Courier, reports to [[Locations/Syndicate_Warehouse|Syndicate Warehouse]])
* [[Characters/NPCs/The_Shade|The Shade]] (Harbor Syndicate Spy Master, operates across Docks)
* [[Characters/NPCs/Greta_Mama_Stoneheart|Greta "Mama" Stoneheart]] (Proprietor of [[Locations/Rusty_Anchor|Rusty Anchor]])
* [[Characters/NPCs/Elara_Lark_Stoneheart|Elara "Lark" Stoneheart]] (Server/Informant at [[Locations/Rusty_Anchor|Rusty Anchor]])
* [[Characters/NPCs/Skarlix|Skarlix]] (Harbor Syndicate Loan Shark at [[Locations/Crow's_Nest|Crow's_Nest]])
* [[Characters/NPCs/Brak|Brak]] (Harbor Syndicate Thug at [[Locations/Crow's_Nest|Crow's_Nest]])
* [[Characters/NPCs/Rorik_Wavebreaker|Rorik "Wavebreaker"]] (Independent Smuggler with ties to Harbor Syndicate)

## V. Services & Amenities
* **Shops:** Few legitimate shops; mostly ship chandlers, rope makers, and purveyors of cheap goods for sailors. Illicit goods are widely available through back channels.
* **Inns/Taverns:** Numerous, mostly rough and ready. Examples: [[Locations/Crow's_Nest|Crow's_Nest]], [[Locations/Rusty_Anchor|Rusty Anchor]].
* **Temples:** Unlikely to find any prominent temples; perhaps small, forgotten shrines to sea deities.
* **Other Services:** Smuggling services, loan sharking (via [[Characters/NPCs/Skarlix|Skarlix]]), fencing of stolen goods (often at neutral taverns), ship repair and outfitting, hiring of rough crew or muscle.

## VI. History
The Docks are one of the oldest parts of [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]], intrinsically linked to its founding and growth as a trade hub. Over centuries, as the city's industry grew, so did the [[Locations/Docks|Docks]], becoming a sprawling, somewhat lawless zone. Criminal elements, particularly the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]], have long vied for and largely achieved control over its lucrative illicit trades.

## VII. Current Events & Plot Hooks
* **Ongoing Conflicts:** The tension between the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]] and the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]] is often palpable, with skirmishes over smuggling routes or attempts to encroach on territory.
* **Rumors & Secrets:** Whispers of valuable cargo, new smuggling methods, identities of informants, locations of hidden stashes, or impending crackdowns by the City Watch (however ineffective). The [[Locations/Rusty_Anchor|Rusty Anchor]] is a key hub for such rumors.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:**
    * Investigating a series of disappearances linked to debt collection by [[Characters/NPCs/Skarlix|Skarlix]].
    * Intercepting a valuable shipment controlled by the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]].
    * Gathering intelligence on Syndicate or Guild movements for [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]].
    * Seeking passage out of or into [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]] discreetly via a smuggler like [[Characters/NPCs/Rorik_Wavebreaker|Rorik "Wavebreaker"]].
    * Using the Docks as an entry point to the [[Locations/Sewer_Network|Sewer Network]].

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Emphasize the grimy, industrial, and often dangerous atmosphere, especially at night. Sounds should include creaking wood, lapping water, distant foghorns or steam whistles, shouting sailors, and the occasional brawl. The scent of fish, brine, tar, dampness, and pollution should be pervasive. It's a place of hard labor by day and shadowy dealings by night. The Harbor Syndicate's presence should feel oppressive. The Docks should feel like a poorer area where grimdark intensity is higher.
