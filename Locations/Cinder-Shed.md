# Cinder-Shed
A large, abandoned metalworks on the border of the Docks and the Shadow Quarter. It was briefly the headquarters for the Rust Dogs gang. After Vaelin dismantled the gang, he used his cantrips to deface the interior with demonic symbols and create poltergeist-like effects, turning it into a "haunted" landmark to serve as a warning to other gangs.
