* **Category:** District
* **Parent Location:** [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]
* **Status:** active
* **Population:** Sparse (wealthy elite, their staff, and city guards)
* **Atmosphere/Vibe:** A stark contrast to the rest of [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]. The air is cleaner, the streets wider, and the architecture grand. It exudes an aura of old money, power, and polished secrets. The grimdark elements are subtle here, manifesting as political intrigue, quiet corruption, and the indifference of the elite.

## III. Geography & Layout
### Physical Description
The [[Locations/High_District|High District]] is a world apart from the grimy industrial sprawl of [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]. Its streets are wide and paved with smooth, clean cobblestones, illuminated by ornate gaslights that cast fewer shadows than elsewhere. Grand manors of polished stone and dark wood rise behind wrought-iron fences, their stained-glass windows hinting at opulent interiors. Manicured gardens and public parks break up the urban density, offering pockets of green respite. The air, surprisingly clean and often scented with exotic flowers, carries only the hushed sounds of distant carriages, polite conversation, and the crisp footsteps of patrolling guards.
### Key Areas/Districts
* **Noble Estates:** Residential areas dominated by the grand homes of the elite.
* **Governmental Sector:** Buildings housing the city's council, courts, and administrative offices.
* **Exclusive Arcane Academies/Guilds:** (Potential) Hidden or discreet institutions for the magically inclined elite.
* **[[Locations/Starfall_Manor|Starfall Manor]]:** The primary base of operations for [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]].

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Emphasize the contrast with other districts â€“ the relative cleanliness, quiet, and apparent order. The grimdark elements here should be subtle, focusing on the insidious nature of power, corruption, and the secrets hidden behind a polished facade. Social encounters and infiltration should be primary.
