# Cogsworth Tenement
A tall, narrow, and partially collapsed tenement building in the [[Locations/Shadow_Quarter|Shadow Quarter]], identifiable by a large, shattered clock face near its peak. The top two floors serve as the primary roost, or "Nest," for [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]]'s [[Factions/Ratlings|Ratlings]]. It is a maze of interconnected rooms and rope bridges, with a large "common room" that contains a makeshift fire pit.
