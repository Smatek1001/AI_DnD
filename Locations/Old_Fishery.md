# Location: Old Fishery

## I. Description
The Old Fishery is a large, dilapidated former fishery located in the grimy [[Locations/Docks|Docks]] district of [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]], situated adjacent to the disreputable [[Locations/Wharf_Rat's_Rest|Wharf Rat's Rest]] tavern. The structure is visibly decaying, with sections appearing to be "practically falling into the harbour." It is now largely abandoned by legitimate commerce and has become a known, if dangerous, haunt for various criminal elements who utilize its crumbling shell for their activities.

The interior is characterized by:
* **Ground Floor:** A vast, cavernous space, dark and filled with debris from collapsed sections, rotted fishing equipment, and general refuse. Notable access points include large, warped loading bay doors and a jagged hole in one wall. A heavy wooden trapdoor in the floor leads to the cellars.
* **Cellars:** An ancient network of vaulted stone chambers and passages beneath the ground floor. This area is consistently damp, humid, with puddles of stagnant water. A distinct, unsettling metallic smell permeates parts of the cellar. Access is via the trapdoor from the ground floor or a submerged passage connected to external, algae-slick stone steps leading into the harbour.

The overall atmosphere is one of grim decay, danger, and secrecy.

## II. Lore & History
Once a significant contributor to Duskhaven's fishing trade, the Old Fishery was abandoned decades ago due to economic decline, structural instability, or perhaps more nefarious reasons lost to time. Its subsequent neglect has made it a prime location for those wishing to operate outside the eye of the City Watch or rival factions.

## III. Points of Interest
* **Main Loading Bay Doors:** Large, iron-banded external doors on the ground floor, now warped and damaged, with one hanging slightly ajar.
* **Jagged Hole in Wall:** A significant breach in a ground-floor wall, offering another external access point, located in an alley near the Wharf Rat's Rest.
* **Algae-Slick Stone Steps:** A flight of treacherous stone steps on the building's exterior, descending into the harbour water and leading to a submerged passage into the cellars. Accessible at low tide.
* **Ground Floor Chamber:** The main, expansive interior space upon entering from the loading bays or jagged hole. Contains the trapdoor to the cellars and is heavily cluttered.
* **Trapdoor:** A heavy wooden trapdoor set into the floor of the ground level, providing internal access to the cellar complex below.
* **Cellar Complex:** A series of low-ceilinged, vaulted stone chambers and passages. Dark, damp, and imbued with a strange metallic odor. This is where [[Characters/NPCs/Magpie_Miri|Magpie Miri]]'s crew was encountered.

## IV. Occupants & Faction Status
* The cellars were recently used by [[Characters/NPCs/Magpie_Miri|Magpie Miri]] and her associates, [[Characters/NPCs/Grol|Grol]] and [[Characters/NPCs/Pip|Pip]], as a place to examine stolen goods.
* Known generally as an occasional hideout or meeting spot for various Docks-based gangs and smugglers. It is not permanently controlled by any single major faction but rather used opportunistically.

## V. DM Notes
* The Old Fishery offers multiple infiltration and exfiltration routes, making it a tactically interesting location for stealth-based encounters.
* The persistent metallic smell in the cellars is a detail that could be developed into a future plot hook (e.g., illicit alchemical work, disposal of evidence using chemicals, a hidden vein of strange ore, decaying clockwork mechanisms).
* The proximity to the Wharf Rat's Rest makes it easy for occupants to come and go with some level of anonymity provided by the tavern's clientele.
