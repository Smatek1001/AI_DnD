# Sylvandell's Mirror

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Sacred Grove / Fey Crossing
* **Parent Location:** Within the ancient northwestern woods [[Locations/Beyond_Duskhaven|Beyond Duskhaven]].
* **Status:** active
* **Population:** None, save for [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] and his familiar [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]] (who manifested here). Implied fey spirits.
* **Atmosphere/Vibe:** A place of profound and ancient fey magic, sublime natural beauty, and palpable otherworldly energy. The air is cool, still, and charged, with faint ethereal music. It feels hallowed and protected by its own ancient magic. The Veil between worlds is exceptionally thin here.
* **Key Features:** A hidden grove of ancient, silver-barked trees whose trunks glow with a soft, internal luminescence. At its center is a perfectly circular pool, about twenty feet across, with a surface as smooth as polished obsidian. Its waters do not reflect the sky or surroundings, but instead show a mesmerizing, slowly swirling tableau of faint, pearlescent colors (blues, greens, lavenders), like captured nebulae or light from another world.

## II. Governance & Power
* **Ruler/Authority:** None (seems to be a domain or touchpoint of the Archfey [[Lore/Pantheon/Caladwen|Caladwen]]).
* **Key Factions Present:** None.
* **Laws & Customs:** Unspoken fey laws of respect and reciprocity likely apply.

## III. Geography & Layout
### Physical Description
Located deep within the oldest parts of the northwestern woods [[Locations/Beyond_Duskhaven|Beyond Duskhaven]], Sylvandell's Mirror is a secluded grove. Ancient, colossal silver-barked trees form a natural enclosure. The ground is carpeted with moss and ancient ferns. The central feature is the mirror-like pool. The light is often dim, filtered through the dense canopy, but the grove has its own luminous quality from the trees and the pool.
### Key Areas/Districts
* **The Grove of Silver Trees:** The encircling ancient trees.
* **The Mirror Pool:** The central, circular pool with its otherworldly reflections.

## IV. Notable NPCs
* [[Lore/Pantheon/Caladwen|Caladwen]]: Can be contacted here via ritual.
* [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]]: Manifested here as [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]]'s familiar.

## V. Services & Amenities
* N/A (Natural, sacred site)

## VI. History
An ancient fey site, its name and nature passed down in fragmented elven lore (as related by [[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]]). It serves as a potent thin place between the Material Plane and likely the Feywild, where contact with entities like Archfey is possible. [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] performed the "Call of the Threshold" ritual here at dawn on Campaign Day 4, successfully forging a pact with [[Lore/Pantheon/Caladwen|Caladwen]].

## VII. Current Events & Plot Hooks
* **Current State:** [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]] and [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]] are currently here, immediately after the pact ritual.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Could be a place [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]] returns to for further communion with [[Lore/Pantheon/Caladwen|Caladwen]]; its fey energies might attract other creatures or entities; it may hold other hidden secrets or paths related to [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]] or the Feywild.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
This is a significant location for Vaelin's Warlock pact and connection to Caladwen and the Feywild. Emphasize its ethereal beauty, potent magical aura, and the unique nature of the Mirror Pool. It should feel distinct from the grimdarkness of Duskhaven.
