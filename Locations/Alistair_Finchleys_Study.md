# Alistair Finchley's Study

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Scholar's Study / Hidden Location
* **Parent Location:** [[Locations/Docks|Docks]] (Old Salt's Tenements area)
* **Status:** active
* **Population:** Singular inhabitant: [[Characters/NPCs/Alistair_Finchley|Alistair Finchley]].
* **Atmosphere/Vibe:** Small, almost claustrophobic, and overwhelmingly cluttered. Every available surface is crammed with books, scrolls, parchments, linguistic charts, and strange tools. The air is thick with the scent of ancient paper, dust, beeswax, and faint, unidentifiable chemicals. Dim, amber light from heavily shaded oil lamps casts long, dancing shadows. It feels like a forgotten archive where lost words reside.
* **Key Features:** Faded blue door mostly hidden by overgrown ivy, a small tarnished brass knocker shaped like a raven. Multiple complex locks. Internally, a monument to organized chaos.

## II. Governance & Power
* **Ruler/Authority:** [[Characters/NPCs/Alistair_Finchley|Alistair Finchley]] is the sole authority.
* **Key Factions Present:** None.
* **Laws & Customs:** Extreme privacy is expected. [[Characters/NPCs/Alistair_Finchley|Alistair Finchley]] does not suffer fools and dislikes being disturbed without good reason. Visitors should state their purpose clearly and concisely. Touching anything without permission is highly inadvisable.

## III. Geography & Layout
### Physical Description
Located in a secluded alley within the Old Salt's Tenements, the study is accessed via a faded blue door, largely obscured by ivy, bearing a raven-shaped brass knocker. The interior is a single, small room.
### Key Areas/Districts
* **Main Study Area:** The entirety of the small room, characterized by towering, leaning stacks of books and scrolls, cluttered tables, and various tools for linguistic and arcane research. A small, relatively clear space on one table is used for examining items. A single, rickety wooden stool serves as the only spare seat. A water clock marks time.

## IV. Notable NPCs
* [[Characters/NPCs/Alistair_Finchley|Alistair Finchley]] (Resident)

## V. Services & Amenities
* **Shops:** N/A
* **Inns/Taverns:** N/A
* **Other Services:** [[Characters/NPCs/Alistair_Finchley|Alistair Finchley]] offers highly specialized (and likely expensive or favor-based) services in linguistic deciphering, translation of ancient/obscure texts, and identification of minor magical properties on artifacts.

## VI. History
The study has likely been [[Characters/NPCs/Alistair_Finchley|Alistair Finchley]]'s secluded workspace for many decades, gradually accumulating its vast collection of texts and research materials.

## VII. Current Events & Plot Hooks
* Recently visited by [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] on behalf of [[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]] to assess an ancient elven artifact.
* A repository of incredibly niche knowledge.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Could be a target for those seeking specific lost knowledge. [[Characters/NPCs/Alistair_Finchley|Alistair Finchley]] might require assistance acquiring a rare text or tool for his research.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Emphasize the overwhelming clutter, the dim light, the specific smells, and [[Characters/NPCs/Alistair_Finchley|Alistair Finchley]]'s particular and reclusive nature. This is not a place for casual visits.
