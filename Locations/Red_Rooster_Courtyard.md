# Location: Red Rooster Courtyard

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Alleyway / Enclosed Space
* **Parent Location:** [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]] (implied to be in the poorer, less-trafficked areas, possibly near the Docks or Shadow Quarter)
* **Status:** active
* **Population:** Sparse (primarily urban vermin, occasionally desperate individuals seeking shelter or hiding something).
* **Atmosphere/Vibe:** Small, squalid, and neglected. The air is still and heavy with the scent of mildew and decaying refuse. It feels like a forgotten, stagnant corner of the city.
* **Key Features:** Enclosed by crumbling tenement backs and a rickety wooden fence. A gnarled tree stump in the center. A crude charcoal 'X' mark.

## II. Governance & Power
* **Ruler/Authority:** None. Largely unpatrolled and ignored by city authorities.
* **Key Factions Present:** None overtly. Used by transient criminals like **Magpie Miri's gang** for temporary hiding or stashing.
* **Laws & Customs:** Survival and opportunistic scavenging.

## III. Geography & Layout
### Physical Description
The **Red Rooster Courtyard** is a small, dismal, and squalid enclosed space. It's bordered on three sides by the crumbling, windowless backs of old tenement buildings, and on the fourth by a tall, rickety wooden fence that offers a precarious barrier to a parallel alley. The ground is uneven, littered with broken bricks, damp, decomposing leaves, and overflowing refuse bins line one wall. The air is thick with the scent of mildew, damp earth, and neglect. A crude, faded charcoal drawing, vaguely resembling a rooster and marked with a large 'X', is scrawled on one of the wooden fence posts. In the center of the courtyard, a gnarled, old tree stump protrudes from the uneven ground.

### Key Areas/Districts
* Small enclosed space.
* Tree stump (where the puzzle box was found).
* Surrounding tenement backs and wooden fence.

## IV. Notable NPCs
* None permanently. Temporarily visited by **Magpie Miri's gang**.

## V. Services & Amenities
* N/A (Not a place of commerce or services.)

## VI. History
Its history is largely unknown, likely a forgotten back alley used by the city's underbelly. Its only known significance is as a place where **Pip** hid the puzzle box containing the **Obsidian Orb**.

## VII. Current Events & Plot Hooks
* **Ongoing Conflicts:** Occasional scavengers might frequent the area.
* **Rumors & Secrets:** Known only to a select few (like **Pip** and now Vaelin) as a potential stash spot. Its obscurity is its primary asset.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Could be a temporary meeting point for small, desperate criminal groups; a potential hideout for a runaway (like **Pip**); a place where other hidden items might be found if its history is explored.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Emphasize its squalor and forgotten nature. It's a minor location, significant primarily for the **Obsidian Orb** and as a plot point for **Pip**. Do not let this location become a major hub unless the player invests in it.
