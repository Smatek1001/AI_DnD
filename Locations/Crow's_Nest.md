# Crow's Nest

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Tavern
* **Parent Location:** [[Docks]]
* **Status:** active
* **Population:** Dense (primarily criminal elements, sailors, and desperate individuals)
* **Atmosphere/Vibe:** Cramped, dimly lit, and permeated by the stench of stale ale and dockside refuse. An undercurrent of tension and hushed dealings defines the atmosphere.
* **Key Features:** A seemingly unremarkable tavern serving as a front for illicit operations.

## II. Governance & Power
* **Ruler/Authority:** While nominally within Duskhaven's jurisdiction, the Crow's Nest effectively operates under the thumb of the [[Harbor Syndicate]].
* **Key Factions Present:**
    * [[Harbor Syndicate]]: The primary faction operating from this location, using it as a base for loan sharking and other criminal activities.
* **Laws & Customs:** The only law is that of the Syndicate; debts are collected ruthlessly, and outsiders are viewed with suspicion.

## III. Geography & Layout
### Physical Description
The Crowâ€™s Nest is a cramped, smoke-filled establishment on the Docks. Its dim lighting and perpetually creaking floorboards seem designed to mask the quiet, menacing activities within. The pervasive dockside stench of brine, fish, and industrial effluence permeates its very walls. Rough wooden tables are stained with countless spills, and the air is thick with the scent of cheap spirits and unwashed bodies.
### Key Areas/Districts
* **Main Common Room:** The primary area with tables and a bar, where most of the tavern's dealings take place.
* **Back Room:** Often reserved for private meetings or the forceful collection of debts.

## IV. Notable NPCs
* [[Skarlix]] (loan shark)
* [[Brak]] (thug)

## V. Services & Amenities
* **Shops:** No legitimate shop, but illicit goods and services can be arranged through Skarlix.
* **Inns/Taverns:** Serves cheap, potent ale and meager, unappetizing food.
* **Other Services:** Loan sharking and debt enforcement.

## VI. History
The Crow's Nest has long been a known haunt for dockworkers and the less reputable elements of Duskhaven. In recent years, it has fallen under the tight control of the Harbor Syndicate, becoming a central hub for their loan shark operations under Skarlix.

## VII. Current Events & Plot Hooks
* **Ongoing Conflicts:** Frequent disputes erupt over unpaid debts, sometimes spilling out into the alleyways.
* **Rumors & Secrets:** Whispers of individuals disappearing after failing to repay Skarlix, or of new, dangerous recruits joining the Syndicate's ranks.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Vaelin might be tasked with retrieving something from a debtor, investigating a disappearance linked to Skarlix, or gathering intelligence on the Harbor Syndicate's finances.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Emphasize the oppressive atmosphere, the constant low hum of threat, and the fact that most patrons are desperate or dangerous. Skarlix and Brak should project
