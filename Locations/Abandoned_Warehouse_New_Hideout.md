# Abandoned Warehouse (Miri's New Hideout)

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Hideout / Ruin
* **Parent Location:** [[Locations/Docks|Docks]] (at the very edge, bordering the forgotten parts of the [[Locations/Shadow_Quarter|Shadow Quarter]]) [cite: 1260]
* **Status:** Active (occupied by [[Characters/NPCs/Magpie_Miri|Magpie Miri]]'s gang as of Campaign Day 7)
* **Population:** Miri, Grol, Pip. [cite: 1538]
* **Atmosphere/Vibe:** Extremely derelict, mostly collapsed. The occupied cellar section is small, debris-filled, and currently holds an air of paranoia and exhaustion.
* **Key Features:** Mostly collapsed upper structure. A more intact lower section/foundation built against a heavy retaining wall for a higher street. [cite: 1272, 1271] The gang entered via a collapsed loading chute into a specific cellar area.

## II. Governance & Power
* **Ruler/Authority:** None (abandoned). Currently claimed by Miri's gang.
* **Key Factions Present:** [[Characters/NPCs/Magpie_Miri|Magpie Miri]]'s Gang.
* **Laws & Customs:** Miri's desperate attempts at order.

## III. Geography & Layout

### Exterior
* Mostly collapsed, skeletal wooden beams, piles of fallen stonework. [cite: 1271]
* A section of foundation/lower walls is surprisingly intact, built against a heavy retaining wall for a higher street. [cite: 1272]
* **Gang's Entrance (South-East?):** A collapsed loading chute, half-buried in rubble, which Miri's gang cleared (noisily) from the outside to access a cellar area. Grol attempted to re-block this from the inside. [cite: 1558, 1617]
* **Vaelin's Secret Entrance (North Wall):** An old, narrow window opening, crudely boarded up. Vaelin pried loose a plank and stones to create a narrow entry into the ground floor, then re-camouflaged it from the outside.
* **Lirael's Potential Grate Access:** A small, heavily rusted iron grate high up (10-12 ft) on the retaining wall side, possibly an old ventilation shaft leading to an upper part of the cellar/crawlspace. Too small for Vaelin, but Lirael could use it. [cite: 1279]

### Ground Floor (Accessed by Vaelin)
* Large, dust-filled spaces, dilapidated. Old, empty, leaning/fallen shelving units. [cite: 1335, 1347]
* **Office-like Room:** Smaller adjoining room, largely filled with collapsed shelving and debris. [cite: 1347, 1419]
    * **Vaelin's Crawlspace Access:** A 2ft square hole Vaelin made in the buckled floorboards, concealed under a battered wooden desk and a crate. Area magically cleaned of Vaelin's traces.
* Collapsed main staircase, leading precariously upwards to skeletal, ruined upper floors (deemed inaccessible/unviable).
* Another potential risky exit/entry: a large, vertical fissure in a buckled outer wall, partially concealed by ivy.

### Crawlspace (Accessed by Vaelin from Office)
* Low (3-4 ft clearance), cramped, uneven earthen floor, debris-strewn.
* Network of low earth-walled passages between foundation supports.
* Seems largely unused; old vermin remains, ancient refuse. [cite: 1403] No other obvious exits. [cite: 1404]
* **Fissure to Target Cellar:** A narrow fissure in a crumbling stonework wall provides a limited view into the cellar Miri's gang occupies.

### Target Cellar (Occupied by Miri's Gang)
* Accessed by the gang via the cleared collapsed loading chute.
* Roughly rectangular, slightly larger and deeper than Vaelin's crawlspace. Rough stone walls, packed earth/rubble floor.
* Choked with debris from the caved-in chute and other partial collapses.
* Contains a few splintered, overturned old crates, rotted organic matter. No obvious valuables. [cite: 1496]
* **Lirael's Vent Shaft Access:** High on one wall, a small, cleared vent shaft Lirael can use, seems to lead into wall cavity/upwards.
* Currently contains: Miri, Grol, Pip (asleep), their meager belongings, a single lantern, the maps, Pip's soiled rag, and Grol's mysteriously clean lavender-scented bed.

## IV. Notable NPCs
* [[Characters/NPCs/Magpie_Miri|Magpie Miri]] [cite: 1539]
* [[Characters/NPCs/Grol|Grol]] [cite: 1538]
* [[Characters/NPCs/Pip|Pip]] [cite: 1538]

## V. Services & Amenities

## VI. History
* An old, abandoned, and mostly collapsed warehouse at the very edge of the Docks, near the forgotten parts of the Shadow Quarter. [cite: 1260] Long derelict.

## VII. Current Events & Plot Hooks
* Currently occupied by [[Characters/NPCs/Magpie_Miri|Magpie Miri]]'s gang as their new hideout after being scared from [[Locations/The_Sinking_Stoat|The Sinking Stoat]].
* [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]] has established his own secret access points and an observation post into their lair.
* The gang is exhausted, paranoid, and planning further petty heists. [cite: 1198, 1582, 1617, 1621]

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
* This is Vaelin's current base of operations for his harassment campaign against Miri's gang.
* Emphasize its dilapidated and unstable nature.
* The gang is trying to secure their chute entrance from the inside. [cite: 1558, 1617]
* Vaelin's access points are currently unknown to them.
