# Therandril

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Lost City
* **Parent Location:** Unknown (Its original location is likely a ruin, its current existence is fragmented memories and echoes)
* **Status:** destroyed
* **Population:** N/A (formerly [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Elf_Race_2024#C. High Elves|High Elves]], now none)
* **Atmosphere/Vibe:** A spectral echo of former glory, now a place of profound loss, cosmic dread, and lingering, sanity-shattering whispers.
* **Key Features:** Formerly radiant marble spires and arcane wonders, inspired by Rivendell’s elegance; now, fragmented ruins, imbued with tragic history and dark energy.

## II. Governance & Power
* **Ruler/Authority:** Formerly ruled by [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Elf_Race_2024#C. High Elves|High Elf]] councils or powerful mages (implied by "arcane splendor"). Now, governed only by the cold, uncaring forces of its destruction.
* **Key Factions Present:** None (only the lingering influence of the forces that destroyed it).
* **Laws & Customs:** N/A

## III. Geography & Layout
### Physical Description
[[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]] was once a radiant [[_DM_Instructions/House_Rules_Extended/Elf_Race_2024#C. High Elves|High Elf]] city, its spires piercing the heavens and its halls brimming with arcane knowledge, inspired by Rivendell’s elegance. Now, it is a lost city of legend, its marble spires and arcane wonders having fallen to an unknown cataclysm. Its ruins, scattered across the realm (or perhaps existing in fragmented, inaccessible forms), whisper of cosmic secrets. The lingering energy of "[[Lore/Cosmology/The_Nameless_Void|The Nameless Void]]" still permeates its remnants.
### Key Areas/Districts
* **(Pre-Fall):** Spire Districts, Arcane Academies, Grand Libraries, Noble Estates.
* **(Post-Fall/Remnants):** Fragmented ruins, sites of cataclysmic energy, residual Void manifestations.

## IV. Notable NPCs
* None (no living inhabitants, only echoes of the past)

## V. Services & Amenities
* N/A (A lost city, not a place of commerce)

## VI. History
[[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]]'s existence was one of radiant arcane splendor, a testament to high elven magic and wisdom. Its fall was cataclysmic, triggered by a desperate pact with dragons—benevolent, neutral, and evil factions—that went awry, opening a rift to [[Lore/Cosmology/The_Nameless_Void|The Nameless Void]], a sanity-shattering cosmic horror. Amid blinding light and screams, [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]] collapsed. This event is the central trauma of [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s past, and the true role of [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]] in its destruction is a secret buried in their agenda.

## VII. Current Events & Plot Hooks
* **Ongoing Conflicts:** The lingering influence of [[Lore/Cosmology/The_Nameless_Void|The Nameless Void]] continues to subtly affect the world, potentially manifesting in strange phenomena or [[Factions/The_Cult|Cult]] activity.
* **Rumors & Secrets:** The existence of [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]] itself is largely forgotten or relegated to legend. The truth of its fall and the extent of the [[Lore/Cosmology/The_Nameless_Void|Void]]'s power are deep, world-shaking secrets.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s personal quest to uncover fragmented memories of [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]]; the discovery of ancient Therandril artifacts (like [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s amulet or tattoo) that hint at its fate; a powerful entity seeking to exploit the residual [[Lore/Cosmology/The_Nameless_Void|Void]] energy from its destruction.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
[[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]] is a cornerstone of [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s backstory and a source of cosmic horror. Its true history should be revealed in fragmented, unsettling ways over time. The "[[Lore/Cosmology/The_Nameless_Void|The Nameless Void]]" is the ultimate, incomprehensible threat. Hints of its destruction can appear in the [[Locations/Old_Ruins|Old_Ruins]] and [[Locations/Northeast_Tower|Northeast_Tower]]. The past beauty and elegance of [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]] should make its tragic fall even more impactful.
