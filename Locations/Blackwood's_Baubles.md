# Blackwood's Baubles

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Shop (Jeweler, dealer in specialty and possibly illicit goods)
* **Proprietor:** [[Characters/NPCs/Silas_Blackwood|Silas Blackwood]]
* **Location:** A modest but well-maintained two-story building in a commercial district of [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]].
* **Atmosphere/Vibe:** Appears as a legitimate jeweler from the front, but handles rare, magical, and sensitive items, likely with connections to an exclusive or shadowy clientele. Security includes at least two guards.

## II. Layout
* **Front Showroom:** Main sales area with display cases (mostly empty or holding token items at night), a sales counter with a till and storage drawers beneath. Gas lighting.
* **Workshop (Rear, Ground Floor):** Cluttered with tools for jewelry and clockwork/arcane tinkering. Contains workbenches, shelves of components. Has a small, high, dusty window to the back alley (forced open by guard, then used by Vaelin) and a door connecting to the front showroom.
* **Upstairs:** Accessed by a narrow wooden staircase from the workshop area. Contains at least Silas Blackwood's private bedroom and a small, cluttered study/office.
    * **Bedroom:** Modestly furnished. Contained a magically warded wooden chest under the bed.
    * **Study/Office:** Contains a roll-top desk, bookshelves, and a locked iron strongbox.
* **Back Alley:** Narrow, contains discarded crates/barrels offering cover. Provides access to the workshop window.

## III. Notable NPCs
* [[Characters/NPCs/Silas_Blackwood|Silas Blackwood]] (Owner)
* Inside Guard (Stout man, was Hexed and slept through the heist)
* Outside Guard (Burly man, patrolled the front)

## IV. Security
* Two guards (one inside, one outside).
* Locks on till and study strongbox.
* Warded wooden box (workshop - Abjuration on box).
* Warded wooden chest (bedroom - Abjuration on chest).
* Hidden catch mechanism on a middle drawer behind the counter.

## V. Key Events
* Successfully heisted by [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] on the night of Campaign Day 5 / early morning of Day 6. Numerous valuable and magical items stolen.
* An "Old Woman" sold Blackwood a deck of Divination cards here earlier on Day 5.
* A "Magister Vayne" is a client or supplier connected to some of the specialty goods (Occulus Array, Resonance Core).

## VI. DM Notes (for AI)
This location served as the site for "The Blackwood Heist." Blackwood is likely to significantly increase security after discovering the theft. The connection to "Magister Vayne" and the "Therandran Protocol" is a major plot hook.
