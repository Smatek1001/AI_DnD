# Abandoned Bakery Attic

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Hideout
* **Parent Location:** [[Shadow Quarter]]
* **Status:** active
* **Population:** Sparse (primarily used by Vaelin and Finch)
* **Atmosphere/Vibe:** Secretive, grimy, yet surprisingly functional and secure. A sense of cautious calm pervades, a small sanctuary in a dangerous city.
* **Key Features:** Hidden entrances, intricate security measures, and a subtly maintained interior despite its derelict exterior.

## II. Governance & Power
* **Ruler/Authority:** N/A (Personal hideout)
* **Key Factions Present:**
    * [[The Society]]: Vaelin's primary affiliation, though this is a personal space not a Society official base.

## III. Geography & Layout
### Physical Description
Nestled above a derelict bakery in Duskhaven’s Shadow Quarter, Vaelin’s hideout is a masterwork of secrecy amid the city’s decay. The bakery below, once “Hearthstone Breads” run by Society sympathizer Marta Hearthstone, is a crumbling shell—windows boarded, door nailed shut, walls streaked with grime. To outsiders, it’s a forgotten ruin, but for Vaelin, it’s a sanctuary where he rests, hides, and plots. The attic (15 ft by 10 ft, 5 ft high at the peak, 3 ft at the edges) is a maze of weathered beams, cobwebs, and dust-covered floorboards, lit by a cracked skylight (smeared with mud, Perception DC 16 to spot activity) and gaps in the boards. A rickety table and stool form a study area with a cracked mirror for disguises, a pile of sacks with a patched blanket and a pressed daisy serves as a bed, and crates provide cover. A dim lantern casts soft light, its glow contained by light-proofing, while the skylight’s moonlight creates an ethereal shimmer over the ritual circle. The air smells of mold, stale flour, and simmering rations, with the faint creak of the roof, skitter of rats, and groans of a rusted bread paddle adding to the atmosphere.
### Key Areas/Districts
* **Hidden Entrance:** In a shadowed alley, a stack of rotting crates hides a narrow gap in the brickwork—just wide enough for Vaelin to slip through (Perception DC 20 to spot, enhanced by mud, ash, mold, ivy, cobwebs). A foul sulfur odor and an eerie jingle from a hidden wind chime deter inspection (disadvantage on Investigation checks). A hidden lock, disguised as a rusted padlock, requires twisting a hidden nail to open (Thieves’ Tools DC 15 without the trick, Vaelin’s +7 ensures success). Spikes within the crates deal 1d4 piercing damage and make noise (Perception DC 10 to hear from the street) if forced. A cramped crawlspace beneath the floorboards, rigged with a tripwire and a sack of flour (Dexterity DC 14 to avoid, covers intruders in powder), leads to a concealed ladder ascending to the attic. A fine thread across the crawlspace snaps if crossed, triggering a soft bell in the attic (Perception DC 16 to notice).
* **Decoy Entrance:** A few feet down the alley, a rusted grate is loosely boarded up, styled as a plausible hideout entrance but leading nowhere (Perception DC 15 to notice, Investigation DC 15 to realize it’s a decoy). False clues—scuff marks, a broken lock—draw attention, and a small bell jingles if disturbed, alerting Vaelin without street attention (Perception DC 10 to hear).
* **Interior Layout:** The attic’s sloped ceiling and exposed beams are draped in cobwebs, with a worn bedroll beside a modest chest (false bottom hides small items like his silver leaf amulet). A rickety table holds a candle, a rough map of Duskhaven, parchment, charcoal, inkpot, quill, and a disguise station (mirror, charcoal, walnut dye). A tattered rug warms the floor, and stolen books hint at Vaelin’s curiosity.
* **Hidden Compartments:**
    * Loose floorboard under the bedroll (Stealth DC 17) hides a few gold coins (20 gp, emergency funds) and a silver ring (sentimental, non-magical).
    * Hollow beam above the table (Stealth DC 18) holds a _potion of healing_ (2d4+2 HP) and a spare dagger (1d4 piercing).
    * Behind a loose beam (Stealth DC 18), a spare disguise kit and a coded note from Talia.
    * Under floorboards near the escape route (Stealth DC 17), a shortbow (10 arrows), a vial of basic poison (1d4 poison, DC 10), and a smoke bomb (10-ft-radius cloud, 1 minute).
* **Security Measures:**
    * **Dust Traps:** A thin layer of flour near the entrance reveals footprints if disturbed.
    * **Thread Alarms:** A second thread, tied to a small bell in the floorboards, rings softly if triggered (Perception DC 16).
    * **Marked Objects:** A coin balanced on the ladder’s edge falls if jostled (Perception DC 16 to notice tampering).
    * **Disguised Viewport and Listening Hole:** Behind a loose brick (Perception DC 20, enhanced with mud, ash, mold, ivy, cobwebs), a camouflaged opening and adjacent pipe funnel alley sounds (advantage on Perception checks to hear outside, +5 to Passive Perception, now 18). Sulfur and jingles deter inspection (disadvantage on Investigation).
    * **Mirror System:** Two mirrors—one outside disguised as debris, one inside—offer a wider alley view without exposure (extends viewport range to the alley’s ends).
    * **Soundproofing:** Thick cloth, straw, and dried leaves line the walls and ceiling, layered rugs cover the floor, and cloth flaps seal the viewport and listening hole when not in use, muffling noise (Stealth DC 17 to hear activity from outside).
    * **Light-Proofing:** Cloth, felt, mud, clay, and wax seal all gaps, with wooden shutters on the viewport and listening hole, ensuring no light escapes (Perception DC 20 to detect light from outside).
* **Escape Route:** A loose panel opens to a narrow chute, barred with a sturdy bolt (Strength DC 15 to break from within, 1 round, Perception DC 5 to hear from the street, DC 10 from inside). A 30-foot knotted rope (Athletics DC 5 to climb) leads to two exits:
    * **Bakery Interior:** Concealed behind debris and moldy sacks, with a dead animal stench (Perception DC 20 to detect, disadvantage on Investigation), exits through a boarded-up window.
    * **Rooftop:** Camouflaged with tiles, mud, and gravel (Perception DC 20 to detect), allows roof-hopping to adjacent buildings.
* **Ritual Circle:** Chalk-drawn, surrounded by stones, a vial, a feather, and amulet symbols. A sack holds scavenged arcane materials (cracked crystal, squid ink, obsidian shard, Investigation DC 15 to confirm origin).
* **Finch’s Access:** Finch enters/leaves undetected, bypassing traps. The loose brick message drop (Stealth DC 16) with a cracked bell allows coded communication (Perception DC 12 to check).
* **Ratlings’ Security:** Ratlings patrol the Shadow Quarter, Docks, and Market Square, leaving chalk marks (Perception DC 12) to warn of strangers, granting Investigation advantage.
* **Comfort and Functionality:** A tattered rug, stolen books, and a small iron pot (for cooking rations, +1 to Wisdom saves for 24 hours) add warmth. Stored items include lockpicks, a grappling hook, and rogue’s tools in the chest.
* **Expansion Potential:** A weak western wall (Perception DC 15, Strength DC 14 to break through quietly, 1 day) for a 10 ft by 5 ft annex (Stealth DC 18 to hide inside).

## IV. Notable NPCs
* [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]] (resident)
* [[Finch]] (Ratlings leader, ally)

## V. Services & Amenities
* N/A (Private Hideout)

## VI. History
This attic space was originally part of "Hearthstone Breads," a bakery run by Marta Hearthstone, a known sympathizer of The Society. After the bakery's abandonment due to unknown circumstances, it became an ideal covert location for Society operatives, eventually repurposed by Vaelin as his personal sanctuary.

## VII. Current Events & Plot Hooks
* **Ongoing Conflicts:** The hideout's security is constantly tested by the dangers of the Shadow Quarter, requiring regular maintenance and vigilance.
* **Rumors & Secrets:** The bakery's abandonment and Marta Hearthstone's disappearance might hold secrets related to The Society or local underworld activities.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** The need for rare components for Vaelin's ritual circle; the discovery of an old Society cache hidden by Marta; an intrusion requiring Vaelin to defend his space.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Emphasize the claustrophobic yet secure feeling of the attic. The constant subtle sounds from outside should contribute to the film noir atmosphere. The complexity of the hideout's security reflects Vaelin's paranoia and skill.
