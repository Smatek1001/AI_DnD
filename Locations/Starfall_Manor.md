Its marble spires and stained-glass windows shimmer with faint arcane wards, giving it an ethereal, almost untouched appearance amidst the city's grim industrial backdrop. Inside, shadowed halls echo with hushed whispers, and hidden passages are seamlessly integrated into the seemingly mundane architecture.

## VI. History
[[Locations/Starfall_Manor|Starfall_Manor]] has been the long-standing, covert headquarters of [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]] in [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]. Its origins are tied to [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]]'s deep roots in the city, and it has served as the nexus for countless clandestine operations that have subtly shaped [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]'s fate. Its very existence is a testament to [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]]'s power and secrecy.

## VII. Current Events & Plot Hooks
* **Ongoing Conflicts:** Internally, there might be subtle power struggles or ideological differences among [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]]'s elders. Externally, it constantly seeks to counter the influence of rival factions like the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]] and [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]], or the emerging [[Factions/The_Cult|The Cult]].
* **Rumors & Secrets:** Whispers within [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]] of new, high-stakes missions or deep dives into ancient, forgotten lore. The true extent of [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]]'s knowledge regarding [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]] is a closely guarded secret here.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** [[Characters/NPCs/Elyndra|Elyndra]] might assign [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] a high-level, sensitive mission originating from the [[Locations/Starfall_Manor|Manor]]; [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] could seek access to its arcane library for information on his past or [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]]; the [[Locations/Starfall_Manor|Manor]] itself might come under threat from an external force, requiring [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] to defend it. [[Characters/NPCs/Elyndra|Elyndra]]’s Therandril knowledge could unlock [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]’s tattoo; [[Factions/The_Society|Society]] missions may draw [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] here.

## VIII. DM Notes (for AI)
Portray [[Locations/Starfall_Manor|Starfall_Manor]] as outwardly grand but inwardly labyrinthine and cold. The atmosphere should be one of deep secrets and quiet power. Every interaction should feel like it has layers of hidden meaning. The NPCs here are highly intelligent and discreet.
