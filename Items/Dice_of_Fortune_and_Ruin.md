# ðŸŽ² Dice of Fortune and Ruin

_Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)_

---

## Summary

A matched set of enchanted Fey dice â€” one **white** (Glimmer), one **black** (Murk). These dice grant powerful magical support to a solo adventurer, simulating buffs, debuffs, healing, and fate manipulation usually provided by a full party. They scale over time and are designed to function without requiring concentration.

---

## ðŸŽ² White Die â€” _Glimmer: Die of Fortune_

**Applies only to the attuned bearer. Always active. No concentration required.**

### ðŸ”¹ Passive Buffs

- **Guided Step:** Add **+1d4** to one ability check per round (as _Guidance_).
- **Blessed Strike:** Add **+1d4** to all attack rolls and saving throws (as _Bless_).
- **Fey Insight:** Gain **advantage on Wisdom (Perception)** checks at all times.
    - Use a **bonus action** to change the affected ability score until the end of your next turn.
    - While taking a **short or long rest**, this defaults to Wisdom (Perception).

### ðŸ’  Healing Properties

> _Glimmer pulses with soft light when wounds open â€” a subtle cheat of fate, like a stitch pulled backward in time._

#### ðŸ©¸ Radiant Surge _(Bonus Action, 2/short rest)_

Restore **2d8 + your Charisma modifier** hit points to yourself.

- At level 10: **3d8 + Cha**
- At level 15: **4d8 + Cha**

#### ðŸŒ¿ Soothing Glow _(Short Rest Enhancement)_

When completing a short rest:

- Regain **maximum value** from Hit Dice (donâ€™t roll).
- Regain **1 additional spent Hit Die**.

#### ðŸ’« Feyspark Resilience _(1/long rest, automatic)_

When reduced to 0 HP, drop to 1 HP instead and immediately regain **3d8 + Cha** hit points.

> Triggers automatically. Recharges on a long rest.

---

## ðŸŽ² Black Die â€” _Murk: Die of Ruin_

**Used to debuff enemies. Requires actions to use.**

### ðŸ”¹ Curse (Action)

Target a creature within 60 ft. It must make a Charisma saving throw (DC = 8 + PB + CHA mod). On a failure:

- **Hex (no damage):** Disadvantage on one ability check type of your choice.
- **Bane:** Subtract **1d4** from attack rolls and saving throws.
- **Curse of Cowardice:** Disadvantage on attack rolls against you.

### ðŸ”„ Shift Curse (Bonus Action)

Move the curse to a new creature within range. The new target must make the same saving throw.

### âš¡ Fateâ€™s Rebuke (Reaction)

When a creature within 60 ft succeeds on a d20 roll (attack, save, or check):

- Force a reroll; they take the lower result.
- **You** gain **advantage** on your next d20 roll before the end of your next turn.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Gamblerâ€™s Edge _(Scaling Buff/Debuff Dice)_

Uses = your **Charisma modifier** (min 1). Recharges on a **long rest**.

### âœ¦ Fortuneâ€™s Favor _(White Die â€” Bonus Action)_

Add the die to one of **your** d20 rolls within 10 minutes. Roll after seeing the d20 but before knowing the result.

### âœ¦ Twist the Knife _(Black Die â€” Reaction)_

Subtract the die from a d20 roll made by a creature within 60 ft. Use after the roll but before the outcome is revealed.

**Die size by level:**

|Level|Die Size|
|---|---|
|1â€“4|d6|
|5â€“9|d8|
|10â€“14|d10|
|15+|d12|

---

## âœ¨ Fatebend _(1/long rest â€” choose one)_

- **Foresight Flash**: Gain _Foresight_ for 1 minute.
- **Perfect Timing**: Replace any d20 roll within 60 ft with a natural 20 or 1 (your choice).
- **Against All Odds**: After failing a d20 roll or taking lethal damage, treat it as a success or reduce damage to 0.

|Tier|Unlock Trigger|New Feature(s)|

## ðŸ§¿ Sentience & Personality

- The dice are semi-sentient spirits who bicker constantly.
- The white die ("Glimmer") is clever, supportive, and sarcastic.
- The black die ("Murk") is manipulative, bold, and loves chaos.
- Their whispers can grow louder as the stakes rise, and they often demand the bearer take bold or risky actions in exchange for power.

## ðŸ§  DM Notes

- Effects are **always active** unless bearer is incapacitated or in an antimagic zone.
- Designed to **replace Bard/Cleric support** in a solo game.
- Both dice scale through **level or narrative unlocks**.
- Customize flavor/voice/personality if dice are sentient (optional).
