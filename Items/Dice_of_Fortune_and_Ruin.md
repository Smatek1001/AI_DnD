# ðŸŽ² Dice of Fortune and Ruin

_Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)_

---

## Summary

A matched set of enchanted Fey dice â€” one **white** (Glimmer), one **black** (Murk). These dice grant powerful magical support to a solo adventurer, simulating buffs, debuffs, healing, and fate manipulation usually provided by a full party. They scale over time and are designed to function without requiring concentration.

- The white die ("Glimmer") is clever, supportive, and sarcastic.
- The black die ("Murk") is manipulative, bold, and loves chaos.
- Their whispers can grow louder as the stakes rise, and they often demand the bearer take bold or risky actions in exchange for power.

- Designed to **replace Bard/Cleric support** in a solo game.
- Both dice scale through **level or narrative unlocks**.
- Customize flavor/voice/personality if dice are sentient (optional).
