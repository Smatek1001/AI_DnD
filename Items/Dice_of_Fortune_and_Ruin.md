# 🎲 Dice of Fortune and Ruin

_Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)_

---

## Summary

A paired set of enchanted Fey dice — one **white**, one **black** — created by rival Archfey gamblers. Meant to aid a lone adventurer, these dice simulate the constant support of bardic and clerical magic. The white die grants powerful, passive boons; the black die punishes foes with curses and manipulation of fate. No concentration required.

## 🎲 Dice Overview

### ⚪ White Die — _Die of Fortune_ aka "Glimmer"

Applies **only to the attuned bearer**. Always active. No concentration required.

- **Guided Step:** Add **+1d4** to one ability check per round (as _Guidance_).
- **Blessed Strike:** Add **+1d4** to all attack rolls and saving throws (as _Bless_).
- **Fey Insight:** Gain **advantage on Wisdom (Perception)** checks at all times.
    - As a **bonus action**, you may shift this advantage to another ability score until the end of your next turn.
    - While taking a **short or long rest**, the default remains Wisdom (Perception).

---

### ⚫ Black Die — _Die of Ruin_ aka "Murk"

Used to debuff enemies. Requires actions to use.

#### **Curse** (Action):

Target a creature within 60 feet. It must make a Charisma saving throw (DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + Charisma modifier). On a failure, the following effects apply:

- **Hex (no damage):** Disadvantage on one ability check type of your choice.
- **Bane:** Subtract **1d4** from all attack rolls and saving throws.
- **Curse of Cowardice:** The creature has **disadvantage on attack rolls against you**.

#### **Shift Curse** (Bonus Action):

Move the curse to a new creature within range. The new target must make the saving throw as above.

#### ✦ _Fate’s Rebuke_ (Reaction):

When a creature within 60 ft **succeeds** on a d20 roll (attack, save, or ability check), you may:

- **Force them to reroll** and take the **lower** result (_Silvery Barbs_ effect).
- **You** (only) gain **advantage** on your **next d20 roll** made before the end of your next turn.

## 🎯 Gambler’s Edge (Scaling Support Dice)

You have a number of uses equal to your **Charisma modifier** (minimum 1). All uses refresh on a **long rest**.

These powers scale like _Bardic Inspiration_ and _Cutting Words_:

|Character Level|Die Size|
|---|---|
|1–4|d6|
|5–9|d8|
|10–14|d10|
|15+|d12|

### ✦ _Fortune’s Favor_ (White Die — Bonus Action)

Add the die to one of **your** d20 rolls within the next 10 minutes. You can roll the die **after seeing the d20 result but before knowing success/failure**.

### ✦ _Twist the Knife_ (Black Die — Reaction)

When a creature within 60 feet rolls a d20, subtract the die roll from their result. You must use this **after the roll but before the outcome is known**.

---

## ✨ Fatebend (1/long rest)

Choose one effect to invoke at any time — no action required:

1. **Foresight Flash** – Gain the effects of _Foresight_ (1 minute duration).
2. **Perfect Timing** – Replace any d20 roll made within 60 ft with a **natural 20** or **natural 1** (your choice).
3. **Against All Odds** – After failing a roll or taking lethal damage, **succeed** the roll instead or **reduce damage to 0**.

## 🧿 Sentience & Personality

- The dice are semi-sentient spirits who bicker constantly.
- The white die ("Glimmer") is clever, supportive, and sarcastic.
- The black die ("Murk") is manipulative, bold, and loves chaos.
- Their whispers can grow louder as the stakes rise, and they often demand the bearer take bold or risky actions in exchange for power.

## 💡 DM Notes (for AI or human DMs)

- Treat the white/black dice as **always “on”** unless the bearer is incapacitated or in an antimagic zone.
- No effects require concentration unless otherwise stated.
- These items are designed to **simulate support from a full party** in a solo campaign.
- Feel free to let the dice evolve or grow more demanding based on the campaign’s Fey themes.
