# Item: Mirror of Fleeting Reflections

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Wondrous Item
* **Rarity:** Uncommon
* **Requires Attunement:** true
* **Source/Origin:** Acquired from [[Characters/NPCs/Silas_Blackwood|Silas Blackwood]]'s shop.
* **Current Owner:** [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] (Currently stowed in [[Items/Secure_Transit_Casket|Secure Transit Casket]])
* **Status:** active

## II. Description
An elegant, perhaps silver-plated, hand-mirror with an ivory handle. Its surface is flawless and imbued with a minor scrying illusion.

## III. Properties & Abilities
* **Usage (Requires Attunement):** Once per day, the attuned user can hold the mirror, speak the name of a creature they have seen before, and concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell) for 1 minute.
* **Effect:** If the creature is on the same plane of existence, the mirror's surface will briefly shimmer and show a vague, shadowy, and entirely silent image of what that creature is currently doing and its immediate surroundings. The image lasts for only a few seconds (no more than 2 rounds of observation) and is imprecise (details are blurry, colors muted, more impressionistic than clear). It provides a general sense of the target's activity and location type.
* **Limitations:** If the target is magically protected from scrying or not on the same plane, the mirror simply shows the user's own reflection.

## IV. Lore & History
A tool for gaining brief, imprecise glimpses of others.

## V. Plot Hooks & Secrets
* Could provide crucial, albeit vague, intelligence.

## VI. DM Notes (for AI)
A minor scrying tool, good for flavor and minor plot hints. Attunement takes a short rest.
