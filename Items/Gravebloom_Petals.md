# Item: Gravebloom Petals

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Consumable (Herbalism)
* **Rarity:** Uncommon
* **Requires Attunement:** false
* **Source/Origin:** Acquired from [[Characters/NPCs/Silas_Blackwood|Silas Blackwood]]'s workshop.
* **Current Owner:** [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] (Currently stowed in [[Items/Secure_Transit_Casket|Secure Transit Casket]])
* **Status:** Active (bundle contains approximately 3 uses)

## II. Description
A bundle of brittle, blackened flower petals tied with simple hemp string. They give off a faint, musty, and slightly sweet odor, like disturbed grave soil mixed with dried funeral flowers. These are the carefully dried petals of the rare Gravebloom flower.

## III. Properties & Abilities
* **Usage (Consumable):** When a pinch of these petals (one use) is burned as incense over a small flame (requiring 1 minute), it releases a thin, greyish smoke.
* **Effect:** For 1 hour after the incense is burned, any creature of CR 1/4 or lower with the Undead type that comes within 30 feet of the user perceives the user as an uninteresting, fellow undead spirit and will not initiate hostilities unless directly attacked or if the user acts in a way that overtly threatens something the undead is guarding.
* **Limitations:** This effect does not influence intelligent undead (Intelligence 6+), undead specifically commanded by a higher power, or any undead creature already hostile towards the user before the incense was burned. It provides passive avoidance, not control.

## IV. Lore & History
Gravebloom flowers are known to grow only in soil sanctified by ancient burial rites or sites with a strong connection to the Shadowfell.

## V. Plot Hooks & Secrets
* Could be useful for navigating minor undead-infested areas.

## VI. DM Notes (for AI)
A niche utility consumable.
