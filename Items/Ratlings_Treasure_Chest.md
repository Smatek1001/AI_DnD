# Item: Ratlings' Treasure Chest

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Key Item

* **Current Owner:** [[Factions/Ratlings|The Ratlings]] (managed by [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]])
* **Location:** Resides in a designated corner of [[Locations/Abandoned_Bakery_Attic|Vaelin's Hideout]].

## II. Description
A sturdy, iron-banded wooden chest, about two feet wide. It's second-hand but well-maintained. The lock is simple but effective, and [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]] holds the only key. It serves as the collective treasury for [[Factions/Ratlings|The Ratlings]] gang.

## III. Properties & Abilities

* **Finch's Key:** The chest can only be opened by a specific iron key that is always in [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]]'s possession.
* **Current Contents:**
    * 100 Gold Pieces (The Ratlings' share from various jobs with Vaelin).
    * Medicine Box

## IV. Lore & History
[[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]] provided this chest to [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]] following the successful recovery of the Ratlings' medicine box during "[[Quests/Completed/The_Ratlings_Remedy|The Ratlings Remedy]]" quest. It was established as a gesture of trust and to give the gang a secure way to manage their resources, strengthening the alliance between Vaelin and the street urchins.

## V. Plot Hooks & Secrets
* The chest and its contents could become a target for rival gangs if its existence and location were ever discovered.
* [[Characters/NPCs/Finch|Finch]] might ask [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]] to temporarily store a particularly valuable or sensitive item for her in the chest.
