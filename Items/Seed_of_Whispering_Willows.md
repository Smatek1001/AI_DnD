# Item: Seed of Whispering Willows

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Wondrous Item
* **Rarity:** Common (with minor fey magic)
* **Requires Attunement:** false
* **Source/Origin:** Acquired from Elmsworth's cottage during "[[Quests/Completed/The_Seed_of_Whispering_Willows|The Seed of Whispering Willows]]" quest. It is of fey origin.
* **Current Owner:** [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]
* **Status:** active

## II. Description
A single, smooth, ovoid seed, about the size of a small bird's egg. It is a pale, pearlescent white and emits a very faint, almost imperceptible internal luminescence, like a trapped moonbeam. It feels slightly warm to the touch and, when held, hums with a subtle, barely tangible vibration, resonating with faint fey magic and echoes of rustling leaves. It was kept in a small, soot-dusted wooden box by the gnome collector Elmsworth.

## III. Properties & Abilities
* **Fey Resonance:** When carried, the seed occasionally emits a faint, almost inaudible hum or whisper, noticeable only to the carrier or those with keen fey senses. It feels faintly warm.
* **Subtle Senses (Flavor):** While the seed is on your person, you have a subtle intuitive sense regarding natural environments; the rustle of leaves might seem to carry a hint more meaning, or the direction of the wind may feel slightly more distinct.
* **Whisper's Carry:** When you are holding the Seed, you can use an action to whisper a message of up to ten words. This message is carried silently, as if on a sigh of wind, to a specific creature you designate and can see within 60 feet. The target creature hears the whisper as if it were spoken right next to their ear, even if there are obstacles or ambient noise, so long as there isn't a completely soundproof barrier. The whisper itself sounds like the rustling of dry leaves. You can use this property a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus (currently 2 for Vaelin), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## IV. Lore & History
Lirael described the Seed as "special to the little people of the deeper woods" and mentioned it "helps... shape whispers. Make them more... convincing." It was "borrowed" by the gnome collector Elmsworth. Its magic is subtle and tied to fey communication and natural whispers.

## V. Plot Hooks & Secrets
* **Known Secrets:** Its ability to carry whispered messages.
* **Hidden Secrets:** Its full potential or history with the "little people of the deeper woods." Could it be planted to grow something unique?
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Other fey creatures might recognize it or seek it. It might react strangely in areas of strong magical influence.

## VI. DM Notes (for AI)
This is a minor magic item intended as a thematic reward for Vaelin, fitting his rogue/Warlock (Archfey) abilities. It provides a useful, limited-use communication tool without being overpowered.
