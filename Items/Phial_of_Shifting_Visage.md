# Item: Phial of Shifting Visage

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Consumable (Potion)
* **Rarity:** Common
* **Requires Attunement:** false
* **Source/Origin:** Found in [[Characters/NPCs/Silas_Blackwood|Silas Blackwood]]'s study strongbox.
* **Current Owner:** [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] (Currently stowed in [[Items/Secure_Transit_Casket|Secure Transit Casket]])
* **Status:** Active (1 use)

## II. Description
A vial filled with a shimmering, sapphire-blue liquid that is cool to the touch. The liquid seems to shift and catch the light in an almost hypnotic way.

## III. Properties & Abilities
* **Usage (Consumable):** As an action, the user can drink the contents of the phial or carefully apply it to their face.
* **Effect:** For the next 10 minutes, faint, illusory shadows, highlights, or blemishes subtly alter the user's facial features. While under this effect, the user has **advantage on one Charisma (Deception) check** made to convince someone that they are a slightly different, unremarkable individual (e.g., to blend into a crowd better or deflect casual recognition).
* **Limitations:** This does not allow impersonation of a specific person. The illusion is too subtle to be detected as magical by casual observation unless the observer is specifically looking for illusions with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against the user's Warlock spell save DC (if applicable, or a general DC 11 otherwise).

## IV. Lore & History
A subtle tool for momentary disguise.

## V. Plot Hooks & Secrets
* Useful for brief moments requiring altered appearance.

## VI. DM Notes (for AI)
A minor consumable for social stealth.
