# Item: Occulus of Scrutiny (Magister Vayne's Monocle)

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Wondrous Item
* **Rarity:** Rare
* **Requires Attunement:** Yes (by a creature with an Intelligence score of 13 or higher)
* **Source/Origin:** Found in [[Characters/NPCs/Silas_Blackwood|Silas Blackwood]]'s study strongbox; part of a set referred to as the "Occulus Array" by "Magister Vayne." This is the primary focusing component.
* **Current Owner:** [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] (Currently stowed in [[Items/Secure_Transit_Casket|Secure Transit Casket]])
* **Status:** active

## II. Description
A set of three articulated clockwork lenses that fold into a compact brass cylinder. When activated by a specific touch sequence, they unfold and attach over one eye via a delicate, conforming clockwork harness. They are a sophisticated tool for detailed examination and arcane perception.

## III. Properties & Abilities
* **Enhanced Investigation:** When all three lenses are properly assembled and worn, the wearer gains **advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks** made to examine small objects, intricate mechanisms, coded messages, or to search for minute details, hidden compartments, or subtle magical runes.
* **Arcane Magnification:** The lenses can be adjusted to provide flawless magnification up to x50.
* **Aura Sight (Requires Attunement):** While attuned and wearing the Occulus, the wearer can use an action to activate its deeper divinatory properties for 10 minutes. During this time, they can see faint auras around any visible creature or object within 30 feet that bears magic (as per *Detect Magic*), revealing the school of magic if present. This ability can be used once, regaining use at the next dawn.
* **Resonance Slot:** The primary monocle features a small, almost invisible slot perfectly shaped to receive a small cylindrical object, clearly designed to interface with another component (such as the [[Items/Contained_Resonance_Core|Contained Resonance Core]]). The function of this interface is not revealed by identifying the lenses alone.

## IV. Lore & History
This device was referred to as part of the "Occulus Array" in a parchment signed by "Magister Vayne." Its presence in [[Characters/NPCs/Silas_Blackwood|Silas Blackwood]]'s possession suggests he was holding it for Vayne or was involved in its creation/modification. It is tied to the "Therandran Protocol" and the "Night of Whispers."

## V. Plot Hooks & Secrets
* What is the full "Occulus Array"?
* What is the purpose of the "Resonance Slot" and its interaction with the [[Items/Contained_Resonance_Core|Contained Resonance Core]]?
* Who is Magister Vayne and what is the "Therandran Protocol"?
