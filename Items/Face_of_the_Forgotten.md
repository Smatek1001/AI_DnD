# Item: Face of the Forgotten

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Wondrous Item
* **Rarity:** Rare
* **Requires Attunement:** true
* **Source/Origin:** Custom
* **Current Owner:** (Not yet acquired by PC)
* **Status:** active

## II. Description
A flawless porcelain mask veined with silvery shadows. When worn, it molds to your face seamlessly. Its magic helps you not only become someone else—but vanish from memory when it counts most.

## III. Properties & Abilities
### Properties (While Attuned and Worn)
#### 1. Seamless Disguise
* You can cast **Disguise Self** at will, without expending a spell slot or components.
* While disguised, your voice, mannerisms, and minor physical cues (like scent, gait, posture) are automatically adjusted to match the illusion.
* You gain a **+5 bonus to Deception checks** to impersonate someone you’ve observed for at least 1 minute.
* Magic that reveals illusions (like *See Invisibility* or *Truesight*) must succeed on a **DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation)** check to see through your disguise unless the creature already knows you’re wearing a magical disguise.

#### 2. Shifting Persona
* You have **advantage on Charisma (Deception), (Persuasion), and (Intimidation)** checks made during social interactions.
* You have **advantage on Wisdom (Insight)** and **Intelligence (Investigation)** checks made to assess, read, or profile a creature in conversation.
* **Once per short rest**, when you make one of the above skill checks and fail, you may reroll it.

#### 3. Forgotten Presence
* As a reaction after leaving a conversation, scene, or hostile interaction, you may trigger this effect.
* Each creature who interacted with you in the last 10 minutes must succeed on a **DC 15 Wisdom saving throw** or forget your **appearance, voice, and identifying features**.
* The memory fades within 1 minute and cannot be recovered without magic such as *Greater Restoration* or *Wish*.
* You can use this feature **once per long rest**. Creatures immune to being charmed are unaffected.

#### 4. Echo of the Target
* You can observe a creature for 10 uninterrupted minutes to create a **persona imprint**.
* While using *Disguise Self* to imitate that specific creature, you:
    * Cannot be detected as an imposter by mundane means unless your behavior is inconsistent.
    * Gain a **+10 bonus to Deception** checks made to impersonate them.
    * Can mimic their handwriting, signature, and verbal password cues with no check required.
* You can store only **one imprint** at a time. Creating a new one erases the previous.

#### 5. Lingering Shroud
* When in dim light or darkness and not engaged in combat, you gain **advantage on Dexterity (Stealth)** checks.
* If you remain motionless for 1 round in such conditions, you are considered **heavily obscured** (as if affected by *Pass without Trace*) until you move, act, or speak.

## IV. Lore & History
(To be discovered in game)

## V. Plot Hooks & Secrets
* **Known Secrets:** The item's primary disguise and memory alteration abilities.
* **Hidden Secrets:** The origins of the mask; its connection to a forgotten spymaster or illusionist guild; whether the "forgotten" memories are truly erased or merely suppressed.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** The mask might have a hidden, more powerful ability that can be unlocked; its use might draw the attention of an organization that seeks to reclaim or control such items; a creature immune to its memory-wiping effect might remember [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] from a previous encounter.

## VI. DM Notes (for AI)
This item strongly supports [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s rogue/spy theme, especially deception and infiltration. Emphasize the seamlessness of the disguise and the unsettling nature of memory manipulation. It should encourage creative problem-solving over direct combat.
