# Item: Obsidian Orb

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Wondrous Item
* **Rarity:** Uncommon (Potentially higher, its true nature is not fully understood)
* **Requires Attunement:** false (Currently)
* **Source/Origin:** Found within a puzzle box buried in the [[Locations/Red_Rooster_Courtyard|Red Rooster Courtyard]].
* **Current Owner:** [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]
* **Status:** active (stashed in [[Items/Secure_Transit_Casket|Secure Transit Casket]])

## II. Description
A small, smooth sphere about the size of a pigeon's egg, crafted from what appears to be polished obsidian. It radiates a faint, pulsing inner light â€“ a deep, unsettling violet hue. It feels cool to the touch and resonates with a faint, almost imperceptible thrum.

## III. Properties & Abilities
* **Resonance:** The orb subtly resonates with the energy around Vaelin's own runic tattoo, creating a faint, familiar thrum in his chest when near.
* **Arcane Focus/Key:** The *Identify* ritual confirms the orb's primary function is to serve as an arcane **focus** or **key**. What it is meant to focus or what lock it might open remains unknown.
* **Alien Aura:** The magic is primordial and utterly alien. The *Identify* ritual failed to categorize it within any of the eight recognized schools of magic. The attempt left the caster with a lingering mental impression of vast, cold emptiness.
* **No Obvious Powers:** At current, the orb does not seem to have any overt powers or functions beyond its strange resonance and aura. Its purpose remains a mystery.

## IV. Lore & History
Discovered in a heavily corroded bronze puzzle box in the forgotten [[Locations/Red_Rooster_Courtyard|Red Rooster Courtyard]], where it was presumably hidden long ago. Its strange, alien nature suggests it is much older than its current resting place. Its connection to Vaelin's tattoo hints at deeper, forgotten lore.

## V. Plot Hooks & Secrets
* **Known Secrets:** Its appearance, its alien magical aura, its resonance with Vaelin's tattoo, and its confirmed nature as an unidentifiable arcane 'focus' or 'key'.
* **Hidden Secrets:** Its true origin, its specific purpose as a key/focus, its connection to [[Lore/Cosmology/The_Nameless_Void|The Nameless Void]] or [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]], and any latent powers it may hold.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** Could be a key to understanding Vaelin's past or the runes on his tattoo; might be sought by other factions interested in ancient or alien magic (e.g., [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]], [[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]], [[Factions/The_Cult|The Cult]]); its powers might be unlocked through arcane research or by bringing it to specific locations.

## VI. DM Notes (for AI)
This orb is a subtle, long-term plot hook. Its resonance with Vaelin's tattoo is important. It should not have any immediate, obvious combat or utility powers, driving Vaelin to research and explore its mysteries. Its magic should continue to feel "alien" and not fit neatly into D&D's standard magical schools. Its true rarity and attunement status can be determined once its full powers are unlocked.
