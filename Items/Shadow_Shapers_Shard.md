# Item: Shadow-Shaper's Shard

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Wondrous Item
* **Rarity:** Common
* **Requires Attunement:** false
* **Source/Origin:** Acquired from [[Characters/NPCs/Silas_Blackwood|Silas Blackwood]]'s workshop.
* **Current Owner:** [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] (Currently carrying)
* **Status:** active

## II. Description
A cool, palm-sized piece of polished obsidian, its dark surface reflecting light with a strange depth. It is imbued with minor transmutation magic allowing manipulation of ambient shadows.

## III. Properties & Abilities
* **Usage:** Once per day, as an action, the user can touch the shard to a point on a surface that is in dim light or darkness (an existing shadow).
* **Effect:** The user can cause that shadow to visibly deepen and stretch, extending one of its dimensions (length or width, user's choice) by up to 5 feet for 10 minutes. This effect enhances an existing area of dim light or darkness, making it more obscure; it does not create magical darkness or reduce the overall light level outside the manipulated shadow.
* **Limitations:** The manipulated shadow must originate from a point the user can touch. The effect ends early if the light source creating the original shadow is removed or bright light illuminates the area.

## IV. Lore & History
A simple tool likely used for minor acts of concealment or stagecraft.

## V. Plot Hooks & Secrets
* Could be useful for enhancing stealth opportunities.

## VI. DM Notes (for AI)
A minor utility item for stealth.
