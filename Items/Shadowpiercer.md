# Item: Shadowpiercer

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Wondrous Item
* **Rarity:** Rare
* **Requires Attunement:** true
* **Source/Origin:** Custom
* **Current Owner:** (Not yet acquired by PC)
* **Status:** active

## II. Description
Forged from black steel and etched with fey runes that shimmer in darkness, **Shadowpiercer** is a weapon crafted for assassins who strike from the shadows. Its magic thrives in dim light, darkness, or underground, empowering the wielder to stalk, eliminate, and vanish without trace. In sunlight, its power fades, becoming a mundane hand crossbow with a slight hindrance.

## III. Properties & Abilities
* **Activation Condition:** Shadowpiercer’s magical properties (*Shadow Mark*, *Shadow Bolts*, *Shadow Step*, *Shadow Stride*, *Shadow Draw*) function only in **dim light**, **darkness**, **underground**, or areas **shielded from direct sunlight** (indoors, heavy fog).
* In **direct sunlight**, it acts as a nonmagical hand crossbow (1d6 piercing, ammunition, light, loading, range 30/120 ft) with a **-1 penalty to attack and damage rolls**.
* **Attunement:** Requires 1 attunement slot.
* **Base Stats:** Hand crossbow (1d6 piercing, light, loading, range 30/120 ft, 3 lb).

### Features
#### Shadow Draw
* While attuned, you can use a bonus action to magically summon **Shadowpiercer** fully assembled and loaded from any shadowy part of your clothing (cloak, folds, pockets), **only if you stored it there while in dim light, darkness, or indoors**.
* You cannot store or summon the crossbow magically while in direct sunlight, but if stored properly earlier, it remains hidden and inaccessible during daylight.

#### Shadow Mark
* **Frequency:** Once per night, recharges at dawn.
* **Action:** Bonus action.
* **Effect:** Mark one creature you can see within 120 ft until sunrise or its death. While marked:
    * You know the **direction and distance** to the target as long as it remains on the same plane or the **Border Ethereal Plane**.
    * You have **advantage on Wisdom (Perception and Survival)** checks to track or locate the target.
    * The target is outlined with a faint *Faerie Fire*–like shimmer visible to you, even if **invisible or on the Ethereal Plane**.
    * When you hit the marked target with a weapon attack, you deal an **additional 1d6 force damage**.
    * The marked target has **disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception and Survival)** checks to detect or track you.
* **Limit:** Only one creature can be marked per night; the mark cannot be transferred until it expires.

#### Shadow Bolts
* **Charges:** 6, recharges at dawn.
* **Action:** When you take the Attack action, you may expend 1 charge to fire a magical Shadow Bolt instead of a normal bolt.
* **Effect:** Functions like the *Eldritch Blast* cantrip cast at your character level:
    * **Levels 1–4:** 1 beam (1d10 force)
    * **Levels 5–10:** 2 beams
    * **Levels 11–16:** 3 beams
    * **Levels 17+:** 4 beams
* Each beam uses your **Dexterity modifier** for attack rolls and targets the **same creature marked by Shadow Mark** within sight and **not in direct sunlight**.
* Automatically reloads; **no ammunition is required**.
* Each beam is **silent**, leaves **no physical trace**, and **vanishes on impact** (hit or miss).
* **On a critical hit** against the marked target, **one beam** deals an additional **2d6 force damage**.

#### Shadow Step
* **Charges:** 3, recharges at dawn.
* **Action:** Bonus action.
* **Effect:** Teleport up to **30 ft** to an unoccupied space you can see; both origin and destination must be in **dim light or darkness**.
* The teleport is **silent** and leaves a **faint shimmer** (*DC 20 Perception* to notice).

#### Shadow Stride
* **Charges:** 1, recharges at dawn.
* **Action:** Bonus action.
* **Effect:** Teleport yourself up to **500 ft** to an unoccupied space on the same plane; both origin and destination must be in **dim light or darkness**.
* Functions like *Dimension Door*, but light-restricted.
* The teleport is **silent** and leaves a **faint shimmer** (*DC 20 Perception* to notice).

### Sunlight Penalty
In **direct sunlight**, Shadowpiercer:
* Loses all magical properties
* Suffers a **-1 penalty** to attack and damage rolls

## IV. Lore & History
(To be discovered in game)

## V. Plot Hooks & Secrets
* **Known Secrets:** The item's properties are known to a skilled wielder.
* **Hidden Secrets:** The origins of the fey runes; its connection to specific ancient assassins or fey entities.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** A former owner might seek to reclaim it; its unique magic might draw unwanted attention from arcane scholars or shadowy organizations.

## VI. DM Notes (for AI)
This item is specifically tailored for [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]]'s desired mechanical progression and his rogue/spy/assassin theme. Its limitations in sunlight create interesting tactical challenges. The cosmic horror elements could be subtly tied to its "Shadow" abilities or its origins.
