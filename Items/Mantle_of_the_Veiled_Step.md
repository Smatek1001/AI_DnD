# Item: Mantle of the Veiled Step

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Wondrous Item
* **Rarity:** Rare
* **Requires Attunement:** true
* **Source/Origin:** Custom
* **Current Owner:** (Not yet acquired by PC)
* **Status:** active

## II. Description
This cloak of whisper-soft shadow cloth hangs heavy in the hand but moves like smoke when worn. Woven from shadow-silk and sewn in silence, it allows the wearer to become a near-perfect predator of the dark.

## III. Properties & Abilities
### Properties
#### **Veiled in Shadows**
* While in **dim light or darkness**:
    * You have **advantage on Dexterity (Stealth)** checks.
    * Creatures have **disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception)** checks to see you.
    * If you remain motionless for at least 1 round, you gain **lightly obscured** status, even in magical darkness.

#### **Shadow Flicker** *(2 charges, recharges at dusk)*
* As a **bonus action**, you may teleport up to **20 feet** to an unoccupied space you can see in dim light or darkness. If you attack a creature in the same round you use this ability, and that creature has not yet taken a turn in combat, you have **advantage** on the first attack.

#### **Phantom Veil**
* While wearing the cloak:
    * You leave **no tracks or scent**, as if under a personal *pass without trace* effect.
    * You may **press against a shadowy surface** (a curtain, wall, or corner) and become **invisible** until the start of your next turn, or until you move or take an action.
    * You gain a **+2 bonus to Initiative** if in dim light or darkness.

## IV. Lore & History
(To be discovered in game)

## V. Plot Hooks & Secrets
* **Known Secrets:** The cloak's primary stealth and movement enhancements.
* **Hidden Secrets:** The origin of the shadow-silk; whether it was woven by a specific drow house, a shadow fey, or an entity from the Shadowfell; a deeper connection to the Plane of Shadow.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** The cloak might lead Vaelin to a hidden sect of shadow-weavers; its magic might react strangely to Void-corrupted areas; a powerful creature of shadow might seek to reclaim it.

## VI. DM Notes (for AI)
This item is designed to heavily support a stealth-based character like Vaelin, especially with his desired Gloom Stalker progression. Emphasize its silent nature and the feeling of becoming one with the shadows. Its features should reward careful positioning and surprise. It pairs *extremely* well with Gloom Stalker, Assassin, or Shadow Monk.
