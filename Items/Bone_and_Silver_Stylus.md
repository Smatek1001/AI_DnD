# Item: Bone and Silver Stylus

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Tool
* **Rarity:** Uncommon
* **Requires Attunement:** false
* **Source/Origin:** Gifted by [[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]]
* **Current Owner:** [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]
* **Status:** active

## II. Description
An intricately carved stylus, fashioned from smooth, polished bone with delicate silver inlays. It is surprisingly balanced in the hand and feels subtly warm to the touch.

## III. Properties & Abilities
* **Resonance Enhancement:** When used for transcription, drawing, or tracing glyphs in arcane texts, the stylus subtly channels and amplifies the user's focus, aiding in comprehension. This provides a minor boon (advantage on a specific Arcana or Investigation check once per long rest, relating to deciphering complex arcane texts, or a +1 to Intelligence (Arcana) checks specifically when studying the *Cipher of Whispers* or similar ancient arcane texts, until this is further defined by DM).
* **Attunement to User:** The stylus subtly attunes to the user's touch and magical signature over time, making it feel increasingly natural and responsive in their hand.

## IV. Lore & History
Gifted by the arcane sage [[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]] to [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] as part of their professional alliance, specifically to aid in the study and decipherment of the *Cipher of Whispers* and other ancient lore. Its design hints at ancient elven craftsmanship.

## V. Plot Hooks & Secrets
* **Known Secrets:** Its ability to aid in arcane study.
* **Hidden Secrets:** Its true origin may be linked to a specific ancient elven order or a renowned arcane scholar.
* **Potential Plot Hooks:** The stylus might react strangely to certain ancient elven ruins or artifacts; its unique magical signature could be recognized by other powerful arcane practitioners, drawing unwanted attention.

## VI. DM Notes (for AI)
This item is designed to mechanically aid Vaelin in his arcane studies, particularly with the *Cipher of Whispers*, reinforcing Elaris's role as a mentor in his pursuit of magical knowledge. Emphasize its subtle magical feel and its utility.
