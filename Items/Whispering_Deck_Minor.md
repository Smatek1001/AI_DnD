# Item: Whispering Deck (Minor)

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Wondrous Item
* **Rarity:** Common
* **Requires Attunement:** false
* **Source/Origin:** Found in [[Characters/NPCs/Silas_Blackwood|Silas Blackwood]]'s shop, wrapped in velvet.
* **Current Owner:** [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] (Currently stowed in [[Items/Secure_Transit_Casket|Secure Transit Casket]])
* **Status:** active

## II. Description
A slim deck of approximately thirty cards made of strangely resilient, smooth pasteboard, cool to the touch. The backs are a uniform pattern of swirling, abstract, dark grey and silver lines that seem to subtly shift.

## III. Properties & Abilities
* **Usage:** Once per day, the user may hold the deck, focus on a specific question, situation, or upcoming event they are contemplating, and draw a single card from the shuffled deck.
* **Effect:** The card drawn will bear a single, evocative image and will also whisper a single, cryptic word directly into the user's mind. This omen is intentionally vague and open to interpretation, offering thematic guidance rather than a clear answer.
* **Replenishment:** After a card is drawn and its omen received, it mystically reincorporates itself into the deck, ready for the next day's use.
* **Limitations:** Does not answer specific yes/no questions or grant mechanical advantages. Purely for narrative guidance.

## IV. Lore & History
A minor tool for seeking cryptic guidance.

## V. Plot Hooks & Secrets
* The omens might lead to interesting roleplaying or decision-making.

## VI. DM Notes (for AI)
A flavor item for minor divination and plot nudges.
