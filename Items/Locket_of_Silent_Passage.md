# Item: Locket of Silent Passage

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Wondrous Item
* **Rarity:** Uncommon
* **Requires Attunement:** true
* **Source/Origin:** Acquired from [[Characters/NPCs/Silas_Blackwood|Silas Blackwood]]'s shop.
* **Current Owner:** [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] (Currently wearing, unattuned)
* **Status:** active

## II. Description
A small, elegantly crafted silver locket, slightly tarnished, on a delicate chain. It is imbued with subtle transmutation magic that muffles the sound of the wearer's movement.

## III. Properties & Abilities
* **Usage (Requires Attunement):** While worn and closed by an attuned creature, the locket magically muffles the wearer's footsteps.
* **Effect:** The wearer has **advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks** that rely on moving silently (e.g., sneaking across creaky floorboards, gravel, etc.).
* **Limitations:** The effect is localized to the wearer and does not create an area of magical silence. It only affects sounds produced by the wearer's movement.

## IV. Lore & History
A useful enchantment for those who tread lightly.

## V. Plot Hooks & Secrets
* Constantly useful for a rogue.

## VI. DM Notes (for AI)
A good thematic item for Vaelin. Attunement takes a short rest.
