# Item: Secure Transit Casket

## I. Overview
* **Category:** Wondrous Item (Magical Container)
* **Rarity:** Uncommon
* **Requires Attunement:** false
* **Source/Origin:** Acquired from [[Characters/NPCs/Silas_Blackwood|Silas Blackwood]]'s workshop during a heist.
* **Current Owner:** [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]
* **Status:** active

## II. Description
This appears as a well-made, sturdy wooden box. Its true value lies in the subtle abjuration magic woven into its construction, designed to shield its contents from magical detection.

## III. Properties & Abilities
* **Magical Shielding:** When the casket is closed and latched, any magical item placed inside has its aura suppressed. Such items become undetectable by spells like *Detect Magic* cast on the outside of the casket. The casket itself radiates a faint abjuration aura but does not reveal the nature or presence of items stored within it to such spells. (Higher-level divination magic might still penetrate its wards).
* **Enhanced Durability:** The wood is magically treated to be slightly more resistant to mundane damage. It has a damage threshold of 1 (ignoring the first point of damage from any single attack or effect) and more hit points than a standard wooden box of its size.

## IV. Lore & History
Likely used by [[Characters/NPCs/Silas_Blackwood|Silas Blackwood]] to store or transport sensitive magical components or creations discreetly.

## V. Plot Hooks & Secrets
* Its effectiveness against more powerful scrying is unknown.

## VI. DM Notes (for AI)
A utility item for Vaelin to hide other magical items.
