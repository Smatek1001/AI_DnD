# Ebon Web Syndicate

## I. Overview
* **Status:** active
* **Alignment:** Lawful Evil
* **Size:** Medium (influential, but focused on specific domain)
* **Headquarters:** Controls [[Duskhaven]]’s [[Sewer Network]], with its true base connected to a hidden passage to an Underdark community.
* **Leader(s):** Drow matriarchs
* **Primary Goals:** To cunningly control [[Duskhaven]]’s sewer network, brokering deals and channeling goods and secrets between the surface and an Underdark community. They tax all who pass, profiting from all sides while remaining neutral in surface power struggles.
* **Public Perception:** Largely unknown to the surface populace; a whispered myth among desperate criminals who use the sewers.
* **Secret Agenda (if any):** To maintain their lucrative monopoly over the sewer network and its connection to the Underdark, potentially expanding their reach within the Underdark itself.

## II. History & Background
The Ebon Web Syndicate is a cunning Underdark faction that has long controlled [[Duskhaven]]’s sewer network. Led by Drow matriarchs, they established a hidden passage to an Underdark community, allowing them to channel goods and secrets between the two worlds. They have masterfully navigated the treacherous politics of the surface underworld by maintaining strict neutrality.

## III. Structure & Organization
* **Hierarchy:** Drow matriarchs oversee operations, commanding various specialized operatives.
* **Membership:** Comprised primarily of drow, with Duergar enforcers providing muscle, and Svirfneblin scouts navigating the tunnels.
* **Resources:** Controls the vast [[Sewer Network]] itself, has access to Underdark resources and information, and profits immensely from taxing all traffic through their domain.

## IV. Allies & Enemies
* **Allied Factions:** Brokers deals with surface fences (e.g., [[Rynna]]), smugglers (e.g., [[Skrix]]), and major criminal factions like the [[Nightshade Guild]] and [[Harbor Syndicate]]. Also collaborates with [[The Cult]] for sewer ritual sites.
* **Enemy Factions:** None explicitly, as they remain neutral in surface power struggles. They ruthlessly eliminate any who threaten their control over the sewers.
* **Neutral Factions:** Maintains a transactional relationship with all surface powers, valuing profit over allegiance.

## V. Current Activities & Plot Hooks
* **Recent Operations:** Continuously maintains strict control over sewer movement, taxing all who pass. Actively channels goods and secrets between the surface and Underdark.
* **Relationship with PCs:** [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s path through the sewers might bring him into contact with their patrols or toll collectors.
* **Plot Hooks:** The Syndicate’s control over the sewer network could be a barrier or a necessary alliance for [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]]’s missions. Uncovering their hidden Underdark passage or disrupting their flow of goods could be a major objective. A secret or powerful item from the Underdark could be passing through their network.

## VI. Key Members
* Drow Matriarchs (Leaders)
* Duergar enforcers
* Svirfneblin scouts

## VII. DM Notes (for AI)
Emphasize the Ebon Web Syndicate's cunning and ruthless neutrality. Their control over the sewers should feel absolute. Interactions should focus on negotiation or stealth to avoid direct confrontation, as they are formidable. Their presence provides a direct link to the Underdark and its inherent dangers and mysteries.
