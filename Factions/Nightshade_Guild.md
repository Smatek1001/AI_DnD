# Nightshade Guild

## I. Overview
* **Status:** active
* **Alignment:** Neutral Evil
* **Size:** Large (extensive network of thieves and spies)
* **Headquarters:** [[Locations/Whispering_Door|Whispering Door]]
* **Leader(s):** [[Characters/NPCs/The_Wraith|The Wraith]]
* **Primary Goals:** To rule [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]’s shadows, thriving on guile and betrayal, and dealing in stolen goods and secrets.
* **Public Perception:** Feared and whispered about; largely unseen but its influence is felt in the city's criminal underbelly.
* **Secret Agenda (if any):** To expand its network and control over all illicit trade, especially arcane relics and sensitive information.

## II. History & Background
The [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade_Guild]] is a formidable network of thieves and spies that rules [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]’s shadows. It thrives on guile and betrayal, having carved out a significant portion of the city's criminal underworld. Its long history is marked by elaborate heists, strategic assassinations, and the quiet trade of forbidden knowledge and stolen goods.

## III. Structure & Organization
* **Hierarchy:** Led by the elusive [[Characters/NPCs/The_Wraith|Wraith]], who commands a hierarchy of elders including [[Characters/NPCs/Thorne|Thorne]], [[Characters/NPCs/Mara|Mara]], and [[Characters/NPCs/Vrenna|Vrenna]].
* **Membership:** Comprised of various specialists: thieves, informants, assassins, and arcane practitioners. Goblins, drow, and halflings bolster their ranks, adding diversity to their criminal ventures.
* **Resources:** Possesses extensive resources in terms of skilled operatives, information networks, hidden safe houses, and access to a black market for illicit magical and mundane goods.

## IV. Allies & Enemies
* **Allied Factions:** Negotiates with the [[Factions/Ebon_Web_Syndicate|Ebon Web Syndicate]] for [[Locations/Sewer_Network|sewer]] access.
* **Enemy Factions:** Clashes frequently with the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]] over territory and resources.
* **Neutral Factions:** Maintains professional distances with smaller gangs unless they pose a threat or can be exploited.

## V. Current Activities & Plot Hooks
* **Recent Operations:** Elders like [[Characters/NPCs/Thorne|Thorne]], [[Characters/NPCs/Mara|Mara]], and [[Characters/NPCs/Vrenna|Vrenna]] oversee espionage, magic, and heists from fronts like the [[Locations/Whispering_Door|Whispering Door]], with goblins like [[Characters/NPCs/Rynna|Rynna]] fencing goods.
* **Relationship with PCs:** [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s rogue skills and connections might make him a target for recruitment or a rival to their operations.
* **Plot Hooks:** The [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]’s clashes with the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]] can lead to direct missions or opportunities for [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] to gain leverage. Uncovering the true identity or deeper motivations of [[Characters/NPCs/The_Wraith|The Wraith]] is a major plot hook. The [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]'s negotiation with the [[Factions/Ebon_Web_Syndicate|Ebon Web Syndicate]] for sewer access could involve [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]].

## VI. Key Members
* [[Characters/NPCs/The_Wraith|The Wraith]] (Guildmaster)
* [[Characters/NPCs/Thorne|Thorne]] (Elder, Espionage)
* [[Characters/NPCs/Mara|Mara]] (Elder, Magic)
* [[Characters/NPCs/Vrenna|Vrenna]] (Elder, Heists)
* [[Characters/NPCs/Rynna|Rynna]] (Fence)
* [[Characters/NPCs/Kyssra|Kyssra]] (Lookout)
* [[Characters/NPCs/Jib|Jib]] (Lookout)

## VII. DM Notes (for AI)
Emphasize the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]]'s cunning and reliance on deception, stealth, and arcane power. Their rivalry with the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]] should be a recurring background element. Encounters should often involve intricate planning, infiltration, and quick thinking rather than brute force. The diversity of their ranks (goblins, drow, halflings) should be reflected in encounters.
