# The Cult

## I. Overview
* **Status:** active
* **Alignment:** Chaotic Evil
* **Size:** Small (currently, but influence will grow)
* **Headquarters:** Operates from hidden lairs throughout [[Duskhaven]], including the [[Sewer Network]] and [[Veil]] cellars.
* **Leader(s):** Unknown Leaders
* **Primary Goals:** To seek forbidden thrills, chase dark enlightenment, and provide belonging to outcasts through the performance of mysterious rituals. Ultimately, to grow their influence.
* **Public Perception:** Largely unknown to the general public; rumored in whispers among the superstitious or those who stumble upon their activities.
* **Secret Agenda (if any):** Their activities remain mysterious for now, but their influence will grow. Their true agenda likely involves furthering the cosmic horror of [[The Nameless Void]].

## II. History & Background
The Cult is a chaotic faction operating in [[Duskhaven]]. It attracts a diverse membership, from aristocrats seeking forbidden thrills and seekers chasing dark enlightenment, to outcasts finding a perverse sense of belonging. Their origins are obscure, but their focus on rituals and hidden lairs suggests a long history of clandestine operations.

## III. Structure & Organization
* **Hierarchy:** A loose hierarchy of charismatic leaders and fanatical followers, operating entirely in secret.
* **Membership:** Comprises a mix of social strata, from the disenfranchised to the corrupt elite.
* **Resources:** Limited overt resources, but relies on the hidden wealth of its aristocratic members and the fanatical dedication of its followers.

## IV. Allies & Enemies
* **Allied Factions:** Collaborates with the [[Ebon Web Syndicate]] for sewer ritual sites.
* **Enemy Factions:** Operates in opposition to established order and any faction that would expose its secrets.
* **Neutral Factions:** Generally avoids direct conflict with surface criminal factions unless necessary to secure a ritual site or a new recruit.

## V. Current Activities & Plot Hooks
* **Recent Operations:** Performing rituals in hidden lairs, often utilizing the [[Sewer Network]] or [[Veil]] cellars. Their activities remain mysterious for now.
* **Relationship with PCs:** Currently unknown, but their growing influence may bring them into conflict or unwitting alliance with [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]].
* **Plot Hooks:** The Cultâ€™s activities could lead to strange disappearances or unsettling phenomena in the city. Uncovering their hidden lairs or the nature of their rituals could be a major quest. They might attempt to recruit [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]] if they sense his connection to the arcane or the Void.

## VI. Key Members
* None yet identified by name, led by "Unknown Leaders".

## VII. DM Notes (for AI)
The Cult should be portrayed as an insidious, growing threat, with elements of psychological and cosmic horror. Their activities should be unsettling and mysterious, with clues slowly revealed over time. Their motivations should be alien or deeply disturbing. The idea of "forbidden thrills" should be a core driver for some members.
