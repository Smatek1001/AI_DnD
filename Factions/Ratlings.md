# Ratlings

## I. Overview
* **Status:** active
* **Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral
* **Size:** Small (about a dozen street urchins)
* **Headquarters:** No formal headquarters; they operate primarily in the [[Shadow Quarter]], [[Docks]], and [[Market Square]].
* **Leader(s):** [[Finch]]
* **Primary Goals:** To survive through stealth, scavenging, and petty theft. They are integral to [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]]’s intelligence and security network.
* **Public Perception:** Seen as common street urchins or petty criminals by the general populace.
* **Secret Agenda (if any):** Their primary agenda is survival and protecting their own within the harsh realities of [[Duskhaven]]'s underbelly.

## II. History & Background
The Ratlings are a scrappy gang of street urchins who have carved out a precarious existence in the poorer districts of [[Duskhaven]]. Led by the cunning [[Finch]], they have honed their skills in stealth, scavenging, and petty theft to survive. They are primarily human but may include goblins or other urchins.

## III. Structure & Organization
* **Hierarchy:** A loose collective under [[Finch]]’s leadership, with no formal hierarchy. Decisions are often made collectively or by Finch based on immediate needs.
* **Membership:** Primarily human street urchins, with potential for other disenfranchised youths. Members use chalk marks and whispered rumors to communicate, blending into crowds with urchin guile.
* **Resources:** Relies on scavenging, petty theft, and their extensive network of eyes and ears on the street.

## IV. Allies & Enemies
* **Allied Factions:** Integral to [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]]’s intelligence and security network, providing him with vital information.
* **Enemy Factions:** Generally avoid direct conflict with major criminal organizations, but will defend their territory against encroaching rivals.
* **Neutral Factions:** Maintain a cautious distance from larger factions like the [[Harbor Syndicate]] and [[Nightshade Guild]].

## V. Current Activities & Plot Hooks
* **Recent Operations:** They patrol for suspicious strangers near [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]]’s [[Abandoned Bakery Attic]], leaving chalk warnings and passing rumors.
* **Relationship with PCs:** They serve as [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]]'s eyes and ears in [[Duskhaven]]’s underbelly.
* **Plot Hooks:** The Ratlings could bring [[Vaelin Shadowleaf]] crucial street-level intelligence; they might be threatened by a larger gang, requiring Vaelin’s intervention; Finch might ask Vaelin to assist with a difficult scavenging operation that turns up an unexpected clue.

## VI. Key Members
* [[Finch]] (Leader)

## VII. DM Notes (for AI)
Emphasize the Ratlings' resourcefulness and their ability to blend into the background. Their chalk marks and whispered rumors are key elements for providing Vaelin with subtle clues or warnings. They are loyal to Finch and, by extension, to Vaelin, but their primary motivation remains survival.
