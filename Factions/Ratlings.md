## II. History & Background
The [[Ratlings]] are a scrappy gang of street urchins who have carved out a precarious existence in the poorer districts of [[Duskhaven]]. Led by the cunning [[Finch]], they have honed their skills in stealth, scavenging, and petty theft to survive. They are primarily [[Human]] but may include goblins or other urchins.

## III. Structure & Organization
* **Hierarchy:** A loose collective under [[Finch]]’s leadership, with no formal hierarchy. Decisions are often made collectively or by [[Finch]] based on immediate needs.
* **Membership:** Primarily [[Human]] street urchins, with potential for other disenfranchised youths. Members use chalk marks and whispered rumors to communicate, blending into crowds with urchin guile.
* **Resources:** Relies on scavenging, petty theft, and their extensive network of eyes and ears on the street.

## IV. Allies & Enemies
* **Allied Factions:** Integral to [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]]’s intelligence and security network, providing him with vital information.
* **Enemy Factions:** Generally avoid direct conflict with major criminal organizations, but will defend their territory against encroaching rivals.
* **Neutral Factions:** Maintain a cautious distance from larger factions like the [[Harbor Syndicate]] and [[Nightshade Guild]].

## V. Current Activities & Plot Hooks

* **Relationship with PCs:** They serve as [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]]'s eyes and ears in [[Duskhaven]]’s underbelly.
* **Plot Hooks:** The [[Ratlings]] could bring [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] crucial street-level intelligence; they might be threatened by a larger gang, requiring [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]]’s intervention; [[Finch]] might ask [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] to assist with a difficult scavenging operation that turns up an unexpected clue.

## VI. Key Members
* [[Finch]] (Leader)

## VII. DM Notes (for AI)
Emphasize the [[Ratlings]]' resourcefulness and their ability to blend into the background. Their chalk marks and network should be utilized as subtle clues for [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]]. Their deep loyalty to [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] is a key factor.
