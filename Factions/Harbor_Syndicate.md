* **Leader(s):** [[Characters/NPCs/The_Anchor|The Anchor]]
* **Primary Goals:** To dominate [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]’s waterfront, controlling smuggling and extortion through warehouses and dive bars. To fuel [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]’s black market.

The [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]] is a brutal criminal empire dominating [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]]’s waterfront. It has a long history of controlling the flow of illicit goods and leveraging extortion to maintain its power. Its operations are characterized by violence and cunning.

## III. Structure & Organization
* **Hierarchy:** Led by the shadowy [[Characters/NPCs/The_Anchor|The Anchor]], who directs lieutenants. Enforcers like [[Korgal Iron Fist]] and smugglers handle operations.
* **Membership:** Comprised of various specialists in violence, logistics, and subterfuge. Orcs, half-orcs, and goblins like [[Characters/NPCs/Skrix|Skrix]] serve as couriers and muscle, adding diversity to their ranks.
* **Resources:** Controls extensive resources including hidden warehouses, dive bars (like [[The Crow's Nest]]), a network of smugglers, and a significant force of enforcers. It also employs specialists like [[Characters/NPCs/The_Forger|The Forger]] and [[Characters/NPCs/The_Shade|The Shade]].

## IV. Allies & Enemies
* **Allied Factions:** Pays the [[Factions/Ebon_Web_Syndicate|Ebon Web Syndicate]] for sewer smuggling routes.
* **Enemy Factions:** Clashes frequently with the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]].
* **Neutral Factions:** Tolerates smaller criminal elements as long as they don't interfere with [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]] operations.

## V. Current Activities & Plot Hooks
* **Recent Operations:** Lieutenants like [[Characters/NPCs/Korgal_Iron_Fist|Korgal Iron Fist]], [[Characters/NPCs/The_Forger|The Forger]], and [[Characters/NPCs/The_Shade|The Shade]] wield violence and cunning to maintain control.
* **Relationship with PCs:** [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] is seen as a potential pawn or threat by [[Characters/NPCs/The_Anchor|The Anchor]].
* **Plot Hooks:** The [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]]’s clashes with the [[Factions/Nightshade_Guild|Nightshade Guild]] can lead to direct missions or opportunities for [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]] to gain leverage. Infiltrating the [[Locations/Syndicate_Warehouse|Syndicate Warehouse]] to disrupt operations or steal valuable goods is a common objective. The [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate|Harbor Syndicate]]'s payment to the [[Factions/Ebon_Web_Syndicate|Ebon Web Syndicate]] for [[Locations/Sewer_Network|Sewer_Network]] access could involve [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin Shadowleaf]].
