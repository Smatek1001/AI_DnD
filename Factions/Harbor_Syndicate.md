# Harbor Syndicate

## I. Overview
* **Status:** active
* **Alignment:** Lawful Evil
* **Size:** Large (dominating [[Duskhaven]]’s waterfront)
* **Headquarters:** [[Syndicate Warehouse]]
* **Leader(s):** [[The Anchor]]
* **Primary Goals:** To dominate [[Duskhaven]]’s waterfront, controlling smuggling and extortion through warehouses and dive bars. To fuel [[Duskhaven]]’s black market.
* **Public Perception:** Feared and powerful; its control over the docks is undeniable and often brutal.
* **Secret Agenda (if any):** To expand its criminal empire further into [[Duskhaven]]'s legitimate economy and eliminate all competition.

## II. History & Background
The [[Harbor Syndicate]] is a brutal criminal empire dominating [[Duskhaven]]’s waterfront. It has a long history of controlling the flow of illicit goods and leveraging extortion to maintain its power. Its operations are characterized by violence and cunning.

## III. Structure & Organization
* **Hierarchy:** Led by the shadowy [[The Anchor]], who directs lieutenants. Enforcers like [[Korgal Iron Fist]] and smugglers handle operations.
* **Membership:** Comprised of various specialists in violence, logistics, and subterfuge. Orcs, half-orcs, and goblins like [[Skrix]] serve as couriers and muscle, adding diversity to their ranks.
* **Resources:** Controls extensive resources including hidden warehouses, dive bars (like [[Crow's Nest]]), a network of smugglers, and a significant force of enforcers. It also employs specialists like [[The Forger]] and [[The Shade]].

## IV. Allies & Enemies
* **Allied Factions:** Pays the [[Ebon Web Syndicate]] for sewer smuggling routes.
* **Enemy Factions:** Clashes frequently with the [[Nightshade Guild]].
* **Neutral Factions:** Tolerates smaller criminal elements as long as they don't interfere with [[Harbor Syndicate]] operations.

## V. Current Activities & Plot Hooks
* **Recent Operations:** Lieutenants like [[Korgal Iron Fist]], [[The Forger]], and [[The Shade]] wield violence and cunning to maintain control.
* **Relationship with PCs:** [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] is seen as a potential pawn or threat by [[The Anchor]].
* **Plot Hooks:** The [[Harbor Syndicate]]’s clashes with the [[Nightshade Guild]] can lead to direct missions or opportunities for [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]] to gain leverage. Infiltrating the [[Syndicate Warehouse]] to disrupt operations or steal valuable goods is a common objective. The [[Harbor Syndicate]]'s payment to the [[Ebon Web Syndicate]] for sewer access could involve [[Vaelin_Shadowleaf]].

## VI. Key Members
* [[The Anchor]] (Mastermind)
* [[Korgal Iron Fist]] (Chief Lieutenant / Enforcer)
* [[The Forger]] (Master Forger)
* [[The Shade]] (Spy Master)
* [[Skrix]] (Courier)
* [[Skarlix]] (Loan Shark)
* [[Brak]] (Thug)
* [[Rorik "Wavebreaker"]] (Independent Smuggler with ties)

## VII. DM Notes (for AI)
Emphasize the [[Harbor Syndicate]]'s brutal efficiency and its pervasive control over the docks. Their reliance on brute force and cunning should be evident. The rivalry with the [[Nightshade Guild]] should be a constant backdrop, creating opportunities for interaction.
