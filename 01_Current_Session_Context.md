## V. DM Notes for Next Session

* Start with Vaelin in his hideout, feeling the lingering effects of the dream.
* Consider having Finch arrive with street intel or a message from Talia to kick off the first canonical mission.
* Emphasize the contrast between the grim exterior of the Shadow Quarter and the relative safety of Vaelin's hideout, reflecting the updated grimdark intensity rule.
