## V. DM Notes for Next Session

* The successful harassment campaign against Miri's gang has effectively neutralized them as active antagonists for the foreseeable future.
* The [[Items/Obsidian_Orb\|Obsidian Orb]] provides a new, tangible lead for Vaelin's arcane research and personal quest.
* Consider how the [[Factions/Harbor_Syndicate\|Harbor Syndicate]] might react to the defeat of Miri's gang and the perceived insult from Skarlix.
* Review Vaelin's desired mechanical progression to guide future opportunities.
