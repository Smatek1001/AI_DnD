# Current Campaign Status - Vaelin's Campaign

## I. Current In-Game Time & Location

* **Current In-Game Date:** Campaign Day 4, Early Morning (Post-Dawn)
* **Days Passed Since Campaign Start:** 3 full days have concluded; Day 4 has begun.
* **Current Party Location:** [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]] and [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]] are at [[Locations/Sylvandell's_Mirror|Sylvandell's Mirror]], a sacred fey grove in the ancient northwestern woods [[Locations/Beyond_Duskhaven|Beyond Duskhaven]].
* **Brief Description of Location:** The grove is bathed in the fresh light of dawn. The pact with Caladwen is newly forged, and Lirael has just manifested. The air is charged with fey magic.

## II. Last Session Recap

* **Last Session Summary:** [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]] successfully performed the "Call of the Threshold" ritual, forging a pact with the Archfey [[Lore/Pantheon/Caladwen|Caladwen]]. He advanced to Rogue 1/Warlock 1. [[Lore/Pantheon/Caladwen|Caladwen]] revealed her past connection to [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]] and [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]], and gifted him [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]] (a [[Bestiary/Flickerling|Flickerling]]) as his Pact of the Chain familiar. [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]] chose Warlock cantrips but deferred his 1st-level spell selections. He expressed his goal to [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]] to find the secret of returning to [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]].
* **PC Status at Last Session End:** As detailed in the frontmatter `current_pc_status`.

## III. Active Quests & Plot Threads

* **Active Quests:**
    * (None formally assigned by an NPC at this moment.)
* **Current Personal Objectives / Plot Threads:**
    * Choose two 1st-level Warlock spells.
    * Determine next steps in the quest for knowledge, answers, and vengeance related to [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]].
    * Investigate [[Lore/Pantheon/Caladwen|Caladwen]]'s claims about [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]]'s role in [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]]'s fall.
    * Understand the full meaning and purpose of his runic tattoo, now known to be bestowed by [[Lore/Pantheon/Caladwen|Caladwen]].

## IV. Notable NPCs & Factions Nearby

* **Notable NPCs:**
    * [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]] (present with Vaelin).
    * [[Lore/Pantheon/Caladwen|Caladwen]] (Patron, strong connection established here).
* **Factions Present:**
    * None directly at [[Locations/Sylvandell's_Mirror|Sylvandell's Mirror]], though [[Lore/Pantheon/Caladwen|Caladwen]] represents a significant fey power.

## V. DM Notes for Next Session

* The immediate focus will be [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]]'s interaction with [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]] and deciding his next course of action.
* He still needs to select his two 1st-level Warlock spells.
* Consider how [[Lore/Pantheon/Caladwen|Caladwen]] might offer further guidance or tasks, or if she expects [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]] to take initiative now.
* The journey back to [[Locations/Duskhaven|Duskhaven]] (if he chooses to return) or further into the wilderness needs to be considered.
