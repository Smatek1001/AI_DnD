    * Uncovering the true nature of [[Factions/The_Society\|The Society]]'s agenda.
    * Investigating the connection between [[Locations/Duskhaven\|Duskhaven]]'s dark history and the fall of [[Locations/Therandril\|Therandril]].
    * Navigating the treacherous alliances and betrayals within the city's underworld.

## V. DM Notes for Next Session

* Start with Vaelin in his hideout, feeling the lingering effects of the dream.
* Consider having Finch arrive with street intel or a message from [[Characters/NPCs/Talia_Whisper\|Talia "Whisper"]] to kick off the first canonical mission.
* Emphasize the contrast between the grim exterior of the [[Locations/Shadow_Quarter\|Shadow_Quarter]] and the relative safety of Vaelin's hideout, reflecting the updated grimdark intensity rule.
