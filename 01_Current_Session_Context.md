# Current Campaign Status - Vaelin's Campaign

## I. Current In-Game Time & Location

* **Current In-Game Date:** Campaign Day 7, Midday (Approx. 12:00 PM)
* **Days Passed Since Campaign Start:** 6 days
* **Current Party Location:** [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]] is in a concealed crawlspace within the [[Locations/Abandoned_Warehouse_New_Hideout|Abandoned Warehouse]] at the edge of the Docks/Shadow Quarter. [[Characters/NPCs/Magpie_Miri|Magpie Miri]]'s gang is asleep in the cellar directly below him. [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]] is also in the cellar, invisible.
* **Brief Description of Location:** Vaelin is in a cramped, dusty crawlspace he accessed via a hidden entry he created. He has an observation fissure into the cellar below. The warehouse is mostly collapsed and derelict.

## II. Last Session Recap

* **Last Session Summary:** Vaelin successfully tormented [[Characters/NPCs/Magpie_Miri|Magpie Miri]]'s gang at [[Locations/The_Sinking_Stoat|The Sinking Stoat]] using illusions and psychological tricks, forcing them to abandon it at dawn. He and [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]] then tailed the gang as they searched for and found a new hideout in an old, collapsed warehouse. While the gang struggled to enter their chosen access point (a loading chute), Vaelin infiltrated the warehouse via his own route, explored its ground floor, created a concealed access to a crawlspace beneath an office, and from there found a fissure to observe the cellar the gang was breaking into. Once they entered, [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]] (via Vaelin's warged senses) scouted the cellar interior, identifying a vent shaft she could use. Vaelin then completed a long rest (elven trance) in the crawlspace while [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]] confirmed the gang fell asleep. The session ended as Vaelin planned to have [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]] search the sleeping gang's belongings.
* **PC Status at Last Session End:** Rogue 1/Warlock 2 (Lvl 3). HP: 24/24. XP: 1950. Warlock Spell Slots: 2/2 (1st lvl, restored). Magical Cunning available. Gold: 6378gp.

## III. Active Quests & Plot Threads

    * [[Quests/Active/Whispers_of_Magister_Vayne|Whispers of Magister Vayne]]: Implicitly ongoing – investigate the parchment.
    * [[Quests/Active/Understanding_the_Oculus_Array|Understanding the Oculus Array]]: Implicitly ongoing – determine nature/purpose of the acquired items.
    * [[Quests/Active/The_House_of_Silent_Stars|The House of Silent Stars]]: Potential follow-up with [[Characters/NPCs/Elaris|Elaris]].
* **Player-Driven Objective:** Continue the campaign of harassment and sabotage against [[Characters/NPCs/Magpie_Miri|Magpie Miri]]'s gang.
* **Key Plot Points Pending:**
    * Vaelin's immediate next step: having [[Characters/NPCs/Lirael|Lirael]] search the sleeping gang's belongings.
    * Decision on what to do with the intelligence gathered on Miri's gang and their new hideout.
    * Addressing the Magister Vayne parchment and associated arcane items.
    * Long-term goals related to [[Factions/The_Society|The Society]], [[Locations/Therandril|Therandril]], and Vaelin's past.

## V. DM Notes for Next Session
* Focus on Lirael's search of the sleeping gang's belongings.
* Miri's gang will eventually wake up; their mood and plans will be influenced by their exhaustion and the previous night's torment.
* Vaelin has a secure observation post and multiple access points to their new lair.
* Consider any external factors (e.g., other denizens of the derelict Docks/Shadow Quarter border area, City Watch patrols if the gang's entry was too noisy despite Lirael's report).
