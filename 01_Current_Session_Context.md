He also acquired a crowbar (which was then given to Finch). Afterwards, [[Characters/PCs/Vaelin_Shadowleaf|Vaelin]] studied the *Cipher of Whispers* with his [[Items/Bone_and_Silver_Stylus|Bone and Silver Stylus]], gaining key insights into how to find locations where the veil between worlds is thin and practicing a meditative technique to enhance his senses.
