# {{campaign_name}} - Campaign Narrative

This document provides a high-level narrative summary of the campaign's story so far, charting the major arcs, key events, and the evolving state of the world and the Player Character(s). It's a living history of our adventures.

## I. Campaign Prologue / Initial Arc: [Arc Title, e.g., "The Whispering Woods"]

(Narrative summary of how the campaign began, the PC's initial motivations, the first major challenges they faced, and the introduction of the primary conflict or major antagonists. Focus on the 'why' and 'what happened' in a storytelling style.)

### Key Events & Milestones (Arc 1)
* **[In-Game Date, e.g., "Day 3"]:** [Brief narrative description of a significant event, e.g., "The PC arrived in Silverwood, seeking their missing mentor, only to find the town plagued by strange disappearances."]
* **[In-Game Date, e.g., "Day 10"]:** [Brief narrative description of a significant event, e.g., "First direct confrontation with the Cult of the Whispering Shadow, revealing their sinister intentions."]
* **(Optional: Link to relevant Session Logs for this arc, e.g., [[20240105_Session_1]] - [[20240210_Session_5]])**

## II. Arc 2: [Title of Next Major Arc, e.g., "Descent into Shadow"]

(Narrative summary of the second significant phase of the campaign. What new challenges emerged? How did the PC's understanding of the world or the main threat deepen? Were there new allies or enemies introduced? What major choices did the PC make?)

### Key Events & Milestones (Arc 2)
* **[In-Game Date]:** [Brief narrative description of event]
* **[In-Game Date]:** [Brief narrative description of event]

## III. Arc 3: [Title of Subsequent Major Arc] (and so on...)

(Continue adding sections for major campaign arcs as they unfold. You can break these down as granularly as you like, perhaps by a major quest line or a shift in geographical focus.)

## IV. Current Campaign Status (Narrative Overview)

(A brief, narrative overview of the current state of the campaign world and the PC(s). Where are they? What is their immediate objective? What major threats loom? What is the prevailing atmosphere? This is a prose-based snapshot of the campaign's present.)

## V. DM Notes (for AI - Campaign Overview)

(Any specific, high-level directives for me regarding the campaign's overall narrative direction, long-term pacing, themes to emphasize, or major plot points you want to ensure I keep in mind as the campaign progresses.)
