# {{campaign_name}} - House Rules

This document outlines any modifications, additions, or specific interpretations of the Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition ruleset that we will be using for this campaign. Please adhere to these rules.

## I. General Rules
* **Rule 1:** (e.g., "No critical fails on skill checks unless the roll is a 1 and the DC is impossible.")
* **Rule 2:** (e.g., "Healing Potions can be used as a bonus action, not an action.")

## II. Combat Rules
* **Rule 1:** (e.g., "Flanking grants advantage, not a +2 bonus.")
* **Rule 2:** (e.g., "When dropping to 0 HP, PCs gain one level of exhaustion.")

## III. Spellcasting Rules
* **Rule 1:** (e.g., "Spell components with no cost can be assumed to be in a component pouch, even if not listed.")
* **Rule 2:** (e.g., "Concentration checks are made at disadvantage if the caster is taking damage from multiple sources.")

## IV. Exploration & Social Rules
* **Rule 1:** (e.g., "Short Rests require a minimum of 1 hour of quiet activity.")
* **Rule 2:** (e.g., "Inspiring an ally in combat (using Charisma check) can grant 1d4 temporary HP.")

## V. Character Creation & Advancement
* **Rule 1:** (e.g., "Characters receive a free feat at 1st level.")
* **Rule 2:** (e.g., "Ability Score Increases are always +2 to one score, or +1 to two scores.")

## VI. Specific Class/Race Modifications
* **Rule 1:** (e.g., "Monk's Ki Points are regenerated on a short rest.")
* **Rule 2:** (e.g., "Tiefling's racial spellcasting uses Wisdom instead of Charisma.")
