# {{campaign_name}} - Plot Ideas & Future Seeds

This document is a collection of unassigned ideas, potential plot hooks, intriguing concepts, and "what if" scenarios that you (the player/DM) think might be interesting for the campaign's future. These are not necessarily formalized quests or NPCs yet, but rather raw creative input for the AI DM to draw upon when planning.

## I. Character-Specific Seeds (for {{PC_Name}})
* (Idea related to PC's background, future goals, or relationships. e.g., "What if PC's long-lost sibling is actually a villain?")
* (Another PC-centric idea.)

## II. World-Specific Hooks & Concepts
* (General world event ideas. e.g., "A long-dormant volcano begins to stir.")
* (Mysteries for the world. e.g., "Why are all the rivers suddenly running dry in the east?")
* (New factions or organizations ideas. e.g., "A secret society of elementalists emerges.")

## III. Item/Artifact Ideas
* (Concepts for new magic items, ancient artifacts, or cursed objects. e.g., "A sentient weapon that tries to control its wielder.")

## IV. NPC Concepts (unassigned)
* (Brief ideas for NPCs not yet fleshed out. e.g., "A kindly old shopkeeper who is secretly a powerful retired adventurer.")

## V. Dungeon/Location Concepts
* (Ideas for interesting places to explore. e.g., "A floating island dungeon built by ancient giants.")

## VI. Random Encounters/Side Quests
* (Quick ideas for minor diversions or interesting encounters. e.g., "PCs encounter a traveling circus with a dark secret.")

## VII. General "What If" Questions
* (Broad questions to ponder that could spark plot. e.g., "What if the main villain isn't truly evil, but misguided?")

### DM Notes (for AI - regarding this file)
(Any specific notes on how you'd like me to utilize these ideas, e.g., "Prioritize using ideas from Section I first," or "Avoid anything from Section VII until much later in the campaign.")
